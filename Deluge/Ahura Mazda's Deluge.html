<h2>THE GREAT DELUGE</h2>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>21</b></p>
</div>



            
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The Maker, Ahura Mazda, of high renown in the Airyana Vaêgô, by the good river Dâitya, called together a meeting of the celestial gods.

The fair Yima, the good shepherd, of high renown in the Airyana Vaêgô, by the good river Dâitya, called together a meeting of the excellent mortals.

To that meeting came Ahura Mazda, of high renown in the Airyana Vaêgô, by the good river Dâitya; he came together with the celestial gods. 

To that meeting came the fair Yima, the good shepherd, of high renown in the Airyana Vaêgô, by the good river DDâitya; he came together with the excellent mortals.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>22 </b></p>
</div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And Ahura Mazda spake unto Yima, saying:
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
O fair Yima, son of Vivanghat I Upon the material world the fatal winters are going to fall, that shall bring the fierce, foul frost; upon the material world
the fatal winters are going to fall, that shall make snow-flakes fall thick, even an aredvi deep on the highest tops of mountains.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>23</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And all the three sorts of beasts shall perish, those that live in the wilderness, and those that live on the tops of the mountains, and those
that live in the bosom of the dale, under the shelter of stables.</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>24 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Before that winter, those fields would bear plenty of grass for cattle : now with floods that stream, with snows that melt, it will seem a happy land in the world, the land wherein footprints even of sheep may still be seen.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>25 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Therefore make thee a Vara, long as a riding-ground on every side of the square, and thither bring the seeds of sheep and oxen, of men, of dogs, of birds, and of red blazing fires.

Therefore make thee a Vara; long as a riding-ground on every side of the square, to be an abode for men ; a Vara, long as a riding-ground on every side of the square, to be a fold for flocks.</b></p></div>



<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>26 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>There thou shalt make waters flow in a bed a hithra long ; there thou shalt settle birds, by the ever-green banks that bear never-failing food. There thou shalt establish dwelling places, consisting of a house with a balcony, a courtyard, and a gallery.</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>27 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Thither thou shalt bring the seeds of men and women, of the greatest, best, and finest kinds on this earth; thither thou shalt bring the seeds of every kind of cattle, of the greatest, best, and finest kinds on this earth.</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>28 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Thither thou shalt bring the seeds of every kind of tree, of the greatest, best, and finest kinds on this earth; thither thou shalt bring the seeds of every kind of fruit, the fullest of food and sweetest of odour. All those seeds shalt thou bring, two of every kind, to be kept inexhaustible there, so long as those men shall stay in the Vara.</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>29 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>There shall be no humpbacked, none bulged forward there ; no impotent, no lunatic ; no poverty, no lying; no meanness, no jealousy; no decayed tooth, no leprous to be confined, nor any of the brands wherewith Angra Mainyu stamps the bodies of mortals.</b></p></div>



<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>30 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>In the largest part of the place thou shalt make nine streets, six in the middle part, three in the smallest. To the streets of the largest part thou shalt bring a thousand seeds of men and women; to the streets of the middle part, six hundred; to the streets of the smallest part, three hundred. That Vara thou shalt seal up with the golden ring, and thou shalt make a door, and a window self-shining within.</b></p></div>



<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>31 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then Yima said within himself: How shall I manage to make that Vara which Ahura Mazda has commanded me to make? And Ahura Mazda said unto Yima: O fair Yima, son of Vivanghat! Crush the earth with a stamp of thy heel, and then knead it with thy hands, as the potter does when kneading the potter's clay.</b></p></div>



<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>32</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And Yirna did as Ahura Mazda wished; he crushed the earth with a stamp of his heel, he kneaded it with his hands, as the potter docs when kneading the potter's clay.</b></p></div>



<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>33 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And Yima made a Vara, long as a riding-ground on every side of the square. There he brought the seeds of sheep and oxen, of men, of dogs, of birds, and of red blazing fires. He made a Vara, long as a riding-ground on every side of the square, to be an abode for men; a Vara, long as a riding-ground on every side of the square, to be a fold for flocks.</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>34 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>There he made waters flow in a bed a hâthra long; there he settled birds, by the evergreen banks that bear never-failing food. There he established dwelling places, consisting of a house with a balcony, a courtyard, and a gallery.</b></p></div>



<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>35 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>There he brought the seeds of men and women, of the greatest, best, and finest kinds on this earth; there he brought the seeds of every kind of cattle, of the greatest, best, and finest kinds on this earth.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>36 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>There he brought the seeds of every kind of tree, of the greatest, best, and finest kinds on this earth; there he brought the seeds of every kind of fruit, the fullest of food and sweetest of odour.

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">

<p><b>And there were no humpbacked, none bulged forward there; no impotent, no lunatic; no poverty, no lying; no meanness, no jealousy; no decayed tooth, no leprous to be confined, nor any of the brands wherewith Angra Mainyu stamps the bodies of mortals.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>38 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>In the largest part of the place he made nine streets, six in the middle part, three in the smallest. To the streets of the largest part he brought a thousand seeds of men and women; to the streets of the middle part, six hundred; to the streets of the smallest part, three hundred that Vara he sealed up with the golden ring, and he made a door, and a window self-shining within.

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then Yima said within himself: How shall I manage to make that Vara which Ahura Mazda has commanded me to make?

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>39 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! What lights are there to give light in the Vara which Yima made?</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>40 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Ahura Mazda answered:<div style="padding-left: 65px;">There are uncreated lights and created lights. There the stars, the moon, and the sun are only once a year seen to rise and set, and a year seems only as a day.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>41 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Every fortieth year, to every couple two are born, a male and a female. And thus it is for every sort of cattle. And the men in the Vara which Yima made live the happiest life. </b></p></div>

<p><b>42 </b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One ! Who is he who brought the law of Mazda into the Vara which Yima made?

Ahura Mazda answered:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"> It was the bird Karshipta, O holy Zarathurtra!</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>43</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Who is the lord and ruler there? Ahura Mazda answered: Urvataad-nara, thy attribute of Zarathustra, O Zarathustra! and thyself, Zarathustra. </b></p></div>
