<p><b>And Terah was seventy-five years old when he begat Abraham. And in the days of Terah, in his ninetieth year, sorcery appeared on the earth in the city of Aôr (Ur), which Horon, the son of `Abhâr, built. Now, there was in the city a certain man who was very rich, and he died at that time. And his son made an image of him in gold, and set it up upon his grave, and he appointed there a young man to keep guard over it. </b></p></div>




<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And Satan went and took up his abode in that image, and he spake to that youth, the son of a rich man, after the manner of his father. And thieves went into his house, and took everything that the youth possessed, and he went out to the tomb of his father weeping. And Satan spake unto him, saying:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"> "Weep not in my presence, but go and fetch thy little son, and slay him here as a sacrifice to me, and forthwith everything which thou hast lost shall be returned to me here." </b></p></div></div>




<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And straightway the youth did as Satan told him, and he slew his son, and bathed in his blood. And Satan went forth immediately from that image of gold, and entered into the youth, and taught him sorcery, and enchantments, and divination, and the lore of the Chaldeans, and how to tell fortunes, and how to forecast events, and how to foretell destinies. And behold, from that time the children of men began to sacrifice their sons to devils and to worship idols, for the devils entered into the images, and took up their abodes therein.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And in the one hundredth year of the life of Nâhôr, when God saw that the children of men were sacrificing their sons to devils, and worshipping idols, He opened the storehouses of the wind, and the gate of the whirlwind, and a blast of wind went forth in all the earth. And it uprooted the images, and the places where offerings were made to devils, and it swept together the idols, and the images, and the pillared buildings in a heap, and piled up great mounds of earth over them; and they are there to this day. Now to this blast of wind learned men have given the name of "Wind-Flood".</b></p></div>




<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>But certain who have erred have said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"> "These mounds existed already in the days of the Flood of waters. </b></p></div></div>



<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Now those who have said these things have erred greatly from the truth; for before the Flood of waters there were no idols in the earth, and it was not because of idols that the Flood came, but because of the fornication of the daughters of Cain. And, moreover, at that time there were no men on this earth, which was a waste and a desert. And our fathers were cast forth in days of old, as it were, into exile, because they were not worthy to be neighbors of Paradise. And through the Ark they were driven forth to the mountains of Kardô, and from there they were scattered about throughout all the earth. For these mounds came into being because of idols, and in them are buried all the idols of that time, and all the devils also who dwell in them are in these mounds, and there is no mound which hath not devils in it.</b></p></div>
