<p><b>2000 BCE</b></p>
</div>            
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>In the opinion of the Archon Philosopher, the Deluge was neither a magical nor religious event, but was rather a change of direction in the management of humans
within the <i>controlled environment</i> that we call earth. Previous to 2000 BCE, Archons were mentoring humans around the world in an effort to jumpstart civilization in order to accomplish the greater objectives of the Demiurgic and other Archonic species. The Greek <em>War of the Titans</em> roughly corresponds in time to a "change of the guard", exchanging what the <i>Book of Enoch</i> called angels, what the Egyptians and Mesopotamians called gods, and what we may generally refer to as Archons. Post-deluge, the success of the Abrahamic and Zoroastrarian monothesisms removed the difficulties of having unfortunate excesses of some of the antedeluvian Archons, including what is mentioned in many places as hybrid births of the Nephilim. Today, we understand enough genetics to postulate sufficient genetic similarity to have this occur.</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px; padding-top: 15px;">
<p><b>Catastrophic Manipulation</b></p>
</div>  
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>As is clear in these many accounts of the deluge, it is not always of water and studies by Anthony L. Peratt of the Plasma Physics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, demonstrate that plasma discharges were likely evidenced across the earth by radical explosive activity of the sun. Given the fact that humans have not drilled more than 12 miles into the earth, given the 26 Second Seismic Blip in the Bight of Bonnie, given the Mayotte Event of November 2018, given the Carrington Event of 1859, we may suggest that earth's controlled environment is able to be radically and catastrophically manipulated. Thus, flood, winds, plasma, induced earth movements and other events variously effected different geographical locations across the earth.</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px; padding-top: 15px;">
<p><b>Changing of the Guard</b></p>
</div>   
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Most Archons then, known by Greeks as Titans, left or were strongly encouraged to depart the beautiful earth, while is seems that some stayed, with or without sanction by the incoming rulers, the Olympians, who have subsequently maintained a respectful distance from human affairs. Some of those possibly staying include: Cadmus, Eliezer, Hermes Trismegistus, Og, Thoth, Nimrod, the founders of the Etruscan Civilization, Seth, paracletes.</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px; padding-top: 15px;">
<p><b>Today</b></p>
</div>  
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>We do not need refer to past documents to determine that there are a current group of Archons who fly craft in our skies and who have an interest in and great power over earth. The <i>Tic Tac</i>, <i>Gimbal</i>, <i>Acorn</i> and others admitted by the Pentagon merely provide a focal point for the thousands of multi-observer sightings with or without technological confirmation. It should be made clear, however, that while the pilots of such craft likely possess sufficiently technology to destroy humans on earth but have not chosen to do so, does not imply that they are necessarily looking out for humans' best interests. As a result, a future deluge remains a possibility on this node of earth within a Type III Civilization.</b></p></div>
