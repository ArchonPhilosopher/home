<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.1</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>When men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.2</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took to wife such of them as they chose</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.3</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then Yahweh said, "My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for he is flesh, but his days shall be a hundred and twenty years."</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.4</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.5</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.6</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. </b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.7</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>So Yahweh said, "I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the ground, man and beast and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them."</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.8</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh. </b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.9</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>These are the Records of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.10</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.11</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.12</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth. </b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.13</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And God said to Noah,"I have determined to make an end of all flesh; for the earth is filled with violence through them; behold, I will destroy them with the earth.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.14</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Make yourself an ark of gopher wood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.15</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its breadth fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.</b></p></div>
            

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.16</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above; and set the door of the ark in its side; make it with lower, second, and third decks. </b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.17</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life from under heaven; everything that is on the earth shall die.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.18</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.19</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.20</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every sort shall come in to you, to keep them alive.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6.21</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Also take with you every sort of food that is eaten, and store it up; and it shall serve as food for you and for them." 

Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>7.1</b></p>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then Yahweh said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you are righteous before me in this generation</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>7.2</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and his mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and his mate;
</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>7.3</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>and seven pairs of the birds of the air also, male and female, to keep their kind alive upon the face of all the earth.
</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>7.4</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>For in seven days I will send rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground." </b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>7.5</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>7.6</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came upon the earth.
</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>7.7</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him went into the ark, to escape the waters of the flood.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>7.10</b></p>

<p><b>And after seven days the waters of the flood came upon the earth.</b></p></div>

<p><b>8.1</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided;</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.2</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.3</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters had abated;</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.4</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest upon the mountains of Ararat.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.5</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.6</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made,</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.7</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>and sent forth a raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.8</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground;</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.9</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>but the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put forth his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.10</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.11</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>and the dove came back to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.12</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then he waited another seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she did not return to him any more.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.13</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.14</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry. </b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.15</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then God said to Noah,</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.16</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>"Go forth from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.17</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh - birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth - that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth."</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.18</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>So Noah went forth, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.19</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves upon the earth, went forth by families out of the ark.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.20</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.21</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And when Yahweh smelled the pleasing odor, Yahweh said in his heart, "I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8.22</b></p>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
