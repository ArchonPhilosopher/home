</div>



            
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Once it came to pass under the Majesty of Re, the self-generated god, that when he had been in the kingship over mankind and the gods combined, mankind proceeded to contrive a plot against the person of Re now that His Majesty, l.p.h., had grown old, his bones being of silver, his flesh of gold and his hair of genuine lapis lazuli. His Majesty became aware of the plot being contrived against him by mankind, and so His Majesty, l.p.h., said to those who were his retinue:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>Please summon to me my Eye, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, and Nut as well as the fathers and mothers who were in my company when I was in Nun, and also the god Nun, bringing his courtiers along with him. It is stealthily that you must bring them lest mankind see and they lose heart as you come back with them to the palace so that they may offer their sound advice. It is within Nun, at the place where I originated, that I shall return.</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>2</b></p>
</div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>So these gods were brought, and these gods were positioned on either side of him, touching the ground with their foreheads in
His Majesty’s presence, so that he might state his problem in the presence of the father of the eldest ones, the maker of mankind and king of humanity. They then said unto His Majesty:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>Speak to us so that we may learn about it.</b></p></div></div>



<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then said Re to Nun:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>O eldest god in whom I originated and you ancestral gods, see, mankind, who originated from my Eye, has contrived a plot against me. Tell me what you would do about this, since I am seeking a solution. I cannot slay them until I have heard what you might have to say about this.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>3</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The Majesty of Nun replied:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>O my son Re, the god mightier than the one who produced you and greater than those who created you, stay put on your throne! The fear of you is great; your Eye shall proceed against those who conspire against you.</b></p></div></div>



<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The Majesty of Re said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>See, they have fled into the desert, their hearts fearful over what I might say to them.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then they said unto His Majesty:<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p>Send out your Eye that it may smite them for you, who have conspired so wickedly. No eye is as capable as it to smite them for you. May it descend in the form of Hathor.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>4</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then this goddess returned after she had slain mankind in the desert. The Majesty of this god said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>Welcome, Hathor! Have you accomplished that for which you set out?</b></p></div></div>



<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>This goddess replied:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>As you live for me, I have overpowered mankind, and it was agreeable to my heart.</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The Majesty of Re said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p>I shall gain power over them as king. Hold off decimating them!</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so Sakhmet came into being.</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>5</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The nightly beer-mash for wading in their blood starting from Heracleopolis. Re said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>Please summon to me speedy emissaries whose pace is as swift as a body’s shadow.</b></p></div></div>



<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>So these emissaries were brought immediately. Then said the Majesty of this god:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>Run up to Elephantine and fetch me red ocher in quantity.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>So this red ocher was brought to him. The Majesty of this great god assigned the Side-locked One who is in Heliopolis to pulverize this red ocher, while maidservants were engaged in grinding barley for beer. This red ocher was then added to that beer-mash so that it was just like human blood. Seven thousand hebenet-jars of beer were thus produced.</b></p></div>



<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then the Majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Re came with these gods to inspect this beer — it was the eve of the day when the
goddess was to slay mankind during her days of journeying south. The words spoken by the Majesty of Re:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>How good it is! I shall preserve mankind from her.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then said Re:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>Transport it please to the place where she said she would slay mankind.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>7</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The Majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Re got up early in the deep of night in order to have this intoxicating draught poured out. Then the fields became filled to a height of three palms with the liquid estimation. She returned so drunk that she had been unable to recognize mankind. The Majesty of Re then said to this goddess:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>Welcome, darling!</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so beautiful women came to be in Imau. </b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The Majesty of Re then told this goddess that intoxicating draughts shall be prepared for her on the seasonal feasts of the year; maidservants shall be held responsible for this. And so the preparation of intoxicating draughts became the assignment of maidservants on the Feast of Hathor on the part of all people since the first day. The Majesty of Re said to this goddess:<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p>Has the heat of sickness become painful?</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so respect is bound to originate through pain. Then said the Majesty of Re:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>As I live for myself, my heart is too weary to remain with them, that I should slay them to the very last one. The reach of my arm shall in no way diminish.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>What the gods who were in his retinue said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p>Don’t withdraw in your weariness, for you still have power over what you desire.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The Majesty of this god then said to the Majesty of Nun:<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p>My body is weak for the first time. I won’t wait until another gets to me.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then said the Majesty of Nun:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>My son Shu, your eye  shall serve your father Re as his protection. My daughter Nut, you shall place him upon your back.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Nut replied:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>But how, my father Nun?</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p><b>Don’t be silly, Nun.</div><p><b>And so Nut became a cow. Then the Majesty of Re placed himself upon her back.</b></p></div>



<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>10</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Thereupon these men came, and they saw him on the back of this cow. Then these men said to him:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>someone has rebelled against you. We have come so that we might overthrow your enemies, who complotted against those who created them.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>His Majesty proceeded to his palace on the back of this cow. He did not set off with them. So the land lay in darkness.</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>11</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>When it dawned in the early morning, these men came out carrying bows and clubs, and they found a way of shooting at the enemies. The Majesty of this god said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p>Your baseness be behind you, o slaughterers; may your slaughtering be far removed from me.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so murderousness originated among mankind.</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>12</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>This god then said to Nut:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>It is in order that I may be uplifted that I have placed myself on your back.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Asked Nut:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>What is this?</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so she came to be there in both the heavens. The Majesty of this god said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>Stay far away from them! Lift me up! Look at me!</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so she became the sky. Then the Majesty of this god was visible within her. She said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>If only you would provide me with a multitude!</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so the Milky Way came into being.</b></p></div>



<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>13</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>There he brought the seeds of men and women, of the greatest, best, and finest kinds on this earth; there he brought the seeds of every kind of cattle, of the greatest, best, and finest kinds on this earth.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>14</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>His Majesty, l.p.h., said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>Peaceful is the field here.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so the Field of Offerings came into being. <div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>I shall make vegetation grow in it.</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so the Field of Rushes came into being. <div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>I shall provide them with everything.</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so planets and stars came into being. Then Nut started trembling because of the height. So the Majesty of Re said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>If only I had millions supporting her!</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so the Infinite Ones came into being.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>15</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The Majesty of Re said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>O my son Shu, place yourself under my granddaughter Nut and watch over for me the two groups of Infinite Ones there so that they may live in the twilight. Place her over your head and nurture her.</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so originated the custom of giving a nurse to a son or daughter. And so originated the custom of a father’s placing a son on top of his head.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>16</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>This spell is to be recited over an image of a cow on whose chest is written "The Infinite Ones who are" and over whose back is inscribed "The Infinite Ones who are" whose four hoofs are filled out in black paint and upon whose belly are a plurality of stars, issuing from its hindquarters in front of its hind legs, while beneath its belly stands Shu, painted in yellow ocher, his arms under these stars, and inscribed with his name between them using the word "Shu" by itself. A barque, on which are a steering-oar and a shrine with a solar disk over it and Re in it, is in front of Shu next to his hand, while another version of a barque is behind him next to his other hand. Its udder is rendered in the middle of its left hind leg, its profile being drawn in paint in the middle of this hind leg with the following words inscribed outside in retrograde: "I am who I am. I will not let them take action." What is inscribed beneath the barque that is in front is as follows: "You shall not grow weary, my son" they the signs being in retrograde, and as follows: "Your condition is like that of one who lives forever" and as follows: "Your son is in me. Life, prosperity and health be to this your nose!"</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>17</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p><b>What is written behind Shu next to his arm is as follows: "Watch over them!" What is behind him at his flank is inscribed in retrograde as follows: "It is right that they should enter in when I retire each day." What is written under the arm of the figure that is beneath the left hind leg and behind it is as follows: "Everything should be sealed." What is inscribed above his head, beneath this Cow’s hindquarters and what is between its hind legs is as follows: "As for him who shall go forth." What is inscribed behind the two figures that are between its hind legs and above their heads: "The aged one is in Igeret. Praise is given, moreover, when he is introduced." What is inscribed over the heads of the two figures that are between its forelegs: "He who adores rectitude, Hearer, Support of the Sky."</b></p></div>



<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>18</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The Majesty of this god then said to Thoth:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p><b>Please summon to me the Majesty of Geb saying, ‘Come quickly at once!’</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>So the Majesty of Geb came, and the Majesty of this god said:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p><b>Take heed because of your snakes which are in you! See, they feared me when I was there. Also you have become acquainted with their magical power. Go now to the place where my father Nun is and tell him to keep watch over terrestrial and aquatic snakes. And also you are to draw up notices with respect to each mound for your snakes that are there, saying, ‘Beware of disturbing anything!’ They should know that I am here, for I am shining for them. Now as for their habitation, it is what will exist in this land forever. Moreover, guard against those magicians who know their spells, since (the god) Magic is himself therein. Now as for the one who ingests him, there I am. The guarding of me originated not through greatness; it originated even before me. I commend them to your son Osiris. Keep watch over the youngest of them and cause the hearts of the oldest of them there to forget their magical power, they who act as they please against the whole world, using their magic which is in their bodies.’’</b></p></div></div>











<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>19</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Then said the Majesty of this god:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p><b>Please summon Thoth to me.</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>So he was brought immediately, and the Majesty of this god said to Thoth:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p><b>Look, I am here in the sky in my abode. Since I am going to produce the light of sunshine in the underworld and the Isle of the Twin Bas, you shall do writing there and calm down for me those who are therein, beings of our own making who fomented rebellion, namely the earth gods, followers of this Irascible One. You are to be in my place, my vicar. Thus you shall be called Thoth, the vicar of Re. Besides, I shall cause you to send out those who are greater than you.</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so the Ibis of Thoth came into being. </b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Besides, I shall cause you to stretch out your hand in front of the primeval gods, who are greater than you; good is the gesture you shall make.</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so the Ibis-bird of Thoth came into being. </b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Besides, I shall cause you to encompass both the heavens with your perfection and with your brightness.</b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so the Moon of Thoth came into being. </b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Besides, I shall cause you to drive back the Haunebut.</b></p></div></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And so the Baboon of Thoth came into being. He is the one who then became vizier. </b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Besides, as long as you are my vicar, the eyes of all who look at you are opened through you, and everyone thanks you.</b></p></div></div>

<p><b>A man shall pronounce this text over himself, rubbed down with olive oil and salve, while holding a censer containing incense in his hands. The backs of his ears should be cleansed with natron, and natron pellets should be in his mouth. As for his clothing, it should be two fresh linen garments after he has bathed himself in flowing water, and he should be shod with sandals of white leather. The image of the goddess Maat should be painted on his tongue in a scribe’s fresh ink. If it is Thoth’s intention to recite this for Re, he is to purify himself with a purification of nine days, and human servitors should do just the same.</b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>As for one who recites this, if he carries out this procedure which is in this book, he increases his lifetime doublefold of excess. His eyes will be of use to him, and all his limbs will be of use to him. His steps will not go astray. It is said of him by people, "He is like Re on the day of his birth." His possessions cannot be diminished, nor can his gateway crumble. A successful method a million times!</b></p></div>

<p><b>When Nun was embraced by the Great One himself, he told the gods who ascend in the east of the sky:<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><p>Give praise to the eldest god, in whom  I originated!

I have no eradicators among men, gods, spirits, and the dead or in anything in this whole world.</b></p></div>

<p><b>As for any able scribe who knows the divine words that are in his mouth, he can ascend and descend within the sky. Those of the West cannot hold him back, nor can the saliva of his mouth become hot. His head cannot be removed by decapitation, nor does he need to bend his arms before the tribunal. He shall enter at the head of the spirits together with those who know the spells in the magical formulary. Not any crime that he may have committed upon earth can be reckoned. Moreover, his provitivessions cannot be diminished, nor can a net be readied against him. Now as for the one whom you hand over to any magistrate or to any spirit, it is he who must care for the one who has no food. His headcloth need not be taken off for the magistrates so that they regard him as leafy  branches. One shall not do anything harmful to him or retard him on his way.</b></p></div>
