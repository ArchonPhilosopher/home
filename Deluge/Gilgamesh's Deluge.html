<p><b><div></div>

<li>Gilgamish said unto him, to Uta-Napishtim the remote:</li><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<li>I am looking at thee, Uta-Napishtim.</li>
<li>Thy person is not altered; even as am I so art thou.</li>
<li>Verily, nothing about thee is changed; even as am I so art thou.</li>
<li>A heart to do battle doth make thee complete,</li>
<li>Yet at rest,  thou dost lie upon thy back.</li>
<li>How then hast thou stood the company of the gods and sought life?</li></b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>Uta-Napishtim said unto him, to Gilgamish:</li><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<li>I will reveal unto thee, O Gilgamish, a hidden mystery,</li>
<li>And a secret matter of the gods I will declare unto thee.</li>
<li>Shurippak, a city which thou thyself knowest,</li>
<li>On the bank of the river Puratti, the great Euphrates, is situated,</li>
<li>That city is old; and the gods dwelling within it</li>
<li>Their hearts induced the great gods to make a windstorm, an a-bu-bi,</li>
<li>There was their father Anu,</li>
<li>Their counsellor, the warrior Enlil,</li>
<li>Their messenger En-urta and</li>
<li>Their prince Ennugi.</li>
<li>Nin-igi-ku, Ea, was with them in council and</li>
<li>reported their word to a house of reeds.</li></b></p></div></div>

<p><b>C. First Speech of Ea to Uta-Napishtim, asleep in the Reed Hut</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>O House of reeds, O House of reeds! O Wall. O Wall!</li>
<li>O House of reeds, hear! O Wall, understand!</li>
<li>O man of Shurippak, son of Ubar-Tutu,</li>
<li>Throw down the house, build a ship,</li>
<li>Forsake wealth, seek after life,</li>
<li>Hate possessions, save thy life,</li>
<li>Bring all seed of life into the ship.</li>
<li>The ship which thou shalt build,</li>
<li>The dimensions thereof shall be measured,</li>
<li>The breadth and the length thereof shall be the same.</li>
<li>Then launch it upon the ocean.</li></b></p></div></div>

<p><b>D. Uta-Napishtim's Answer to Ea</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>I understood and I said unto Ea, my lord:</li><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<li>See, my lord, that which thou hast ordered,</li>
<li>I regard with reverence, and will perform it,</li>
<li>But what shall I say to the town, to the multitude, and to the elders?</li></b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>E. Second Speech of Ea</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>Ea opened his mouth and spake </li><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<li>And said unto his servant, myself,</li>
<li>Thus, man, shalt thou say unto them:</li>
<li>Ill-will hath the god Enlil formed against me,</li>
<li>Therefore I can no longer dwell. in your city,</li>
<li>And never more will I turn my countenance upon-the soil of Enlil.</li>
<li>I will descend into the ocean to dwell with my lord Ea.</li>
<li>But upon you he will rain riches</li>
<li>A catch of birds, a catch of fish</li>
<li> . . . an abundant harvest,</li>
<li> . . . the sender of . . .</li>

<li>55. The child brought bitumen,</li>
<li>The strong man brought what was needed.</li>
<li>On the fifth day I laid down its shape.</li>
<li>According to the plan its walls were 10 gar, at 120 cubits, high,</li>
<li>And the width of its deck was equally 10 gar.</li>
<li>I laid down the shape of its forepart and marked it out.</li>
<li>I covered it six times.</li>
<li>I divided into seven,</li>
<li>Its interior I divided into nine,</li>
<li>Caulking I drove into the middle of it.</li>
<li>I provided a steering pole, and cast in all that was needful.</li>
<li>Six sar of bitumen I poured over the hull,</li>
<li>Three sar of pitch I poured into the inside.</li>
<li>The men who bear loads brought three sar of oil,</li>
<li>Besides a sar of oil which the tackling consumed,</li>
<li>And two sar of oil which the boatman hid.</li>
<li>I slaughtered oxen for the people,</li>
<li>I slew sheep every day.</li>
<li>Beer, sesame wine, oil and wine</li>
<li>I made the people drink as if they were water from the river.</li>
<li>I celebrated a feast as if it had been New Year's Day.</li>
<li>I opened a box of ointment, I laid my hands in unguent.</li>
<li>Before sunset the ship was finished.</li>
<li>Thus so was difficult.</li>
<li>The shipbuilders brought the fittings of the ship, above and below,</li>
<li>Thus was covered over by two-thirds of it.</li></b></p></div>

<p><b>G. Loading of the Ship</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>With everything that I possessed I loaded the ship.</li>
<li>With everything that I possessed of silver I loaded it.</li>
<li>With everything that I possessed of gold I loaded it.</li>
<li>With all that I possessed of all the seed of life I loaded it.</li>
<li>I made to go up into the ship all my family and kinsfolk,</li>
<li>The cattle of the field, the beasts of the field, all handicraftsmen I made them go up into it.</li>
<li>The god Shamash had appointed me a time</li>
<li>The sender of . . . . . will at eventide make a hail to fall;</li>
<li>Then enter into the ship and shut thy door.</li>
<li>The appointed time drew nigh;</li>
<li>The sender of . . . . . made a hail to fall at eventide.</li>
<li>I watched the aspect of the approaching storm,</li>
<li>Terror possessed me to look upon it,</li>
<li>I went into the ship and shut my door.</li>
<li>To the pilot of the ship, Puzur-Enlil the sailor</li>
<li>I committed the great house, this ship, together with the contents thereof.</li></b></p></div>

<p><b>H. The Abubu Cyclone Described</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>As soon as something of dawn shone in the sky</li>
<li>A black cloud from the foundation of heaven came up.</li>
<li>Inside it the god Adad thundered,</li>
<li>The gods Nab√ª and Sharru, as Marduk, went before,</li>
<li>Marching as messengers over high land and plain,</li>
<li>Irragal (Nergal) tore out the post of the ship,</li>
<li>En-urta went on, he made the storm to descend.</li>
<li>The Anunnaki brandished their torches,</li>
<li>With their glare they lighted up the land.</li>
<li>The whirlwind, great cyclone, of Adad swept up to heaven.</li>
<li>Every gleam of light was turned into darkness.</li>
<li> . . . . . the land . . . . . as if had laid it waste.</li>
<li>A whole day long the flood descended . . .</li>
<li>Swiftly it mounted up, the water reached to the mountains</li>
<li>The water attacked the people like a battle.</li>
<li>Brother saw not brother.</li>
<li>Men could not be known (or, recognized) in heaven.</li>
<li>The gods were terrified at the cyclone.</li>
<li>They shrank back and went up into the heaven of Anu.</li>
<li>The gods crouched like a dog and cowered by the wall.</li></b></p></div>

<p><b>I. Ishtar's Lament</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>The goddess Ishtar cried out like a woman in travail.</li>
<li>The Lady of the Gods lamented with a sweet voice saying:</li><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<li>May that former day be turned into mud,</li>
<li>Because I commanded evil among the company of the gods.</li>
<li>How could I command evil among the company of the gods,</li>
<li>Command battle for the destruction of my people?</li>
<li>Did I of myself bring forth my people</li>
<li>That they might fill the sea like little fishes?</li></b></p></div></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">

<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>The gods, the Anunnaki wailed with her.</li>
<li>The gods bowed themselves, and sat down weeping.</li>
<li>Their lips were shut tight (in distress) . . .</li>
<li>For six days and nights</li>
<li>The wind, the storm raged, and the cyclone overwhelmed the land.</li></b></p></div></div>

<p><b>K. Abating of the Storn</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>When the seventh day came the cyclone ceased, the storm and battle</li>
<li>which had fought like an army.</li>
<li>The sea became quiet, the grievous wind went down, the cyclone ceased.</li>
<li>I looked on the day and voices were stilled,</li>
<li>And all mankind were turned into mud,</li>
<li>The land had been laid flat like a terrace.</li>
<li>I opened the air-hole and the light fell upon my cheek,</li>
<li>I bowed myself, I sat down, I cried,</li>
<li>My tears poured down over my cheeks.</li>
<li>I looked over the quarters of the world, to the limits of ocean.</li>
<li>At twelve points islands appeared.</li>
<li>The ship grounded on the mountain of Nisir.</li>
<li>The mountain of Nisir held the ship, it let it not move.</li>
<li>The first day, the second day, the mountain of Nisir held the ship and let it not move.</li>
<li>The third day, the fourth day, the mountain of Nisir held the ship and let it not move.</li>
<li>The fifth day, the sixth day, the mountain of Nisir held the ship and let it not move.</li>
<li>When the seventh day had come</li>
<li>I brought out a dove and let her go free.</li>
<li>The dove flew away and then came back;</li>
<li>Because she had no place to alight on she came back.</li>
<li>I brought out a swallow and let her go free.</li>
<li>The swallow flew away and then came back;</li>
<li>Because she had no place to alight on she came back.</li>
<li>I brought out a raven and let her go free.</li>
<li>The raven flew away, she saw the sinking waters.</li>
<li>She ate, she waded, she rose, she came not back.</li></b></p></div>

</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;"><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>Then I brought out everything to the four winds and made a sacrifice;</li>
<li>I set out an offering on the peak of the mountain.</li>
<li>Seven by seven I set out the vessels,</li>
<li>Under them I piled reeds, cedarwood and myrtle.</li>
<li>The gods smelt the savour,</li>
<li>The gods smelt the sweet savour.</li>
<li>The gods gathered together like flies over him that sacrificed.</li></b></p></div></div>

<p><b>M. Ishtar Responds</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>Now when the Lady of the Gods came nigh,</li>
<li>She lifted up the priceless jewels which Anu had made according to her desire, saying:</li><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<li>O ye gods here present, as I shall never forget the sapphire jewels of my neck</li>
<li>So shall I ever think about these days, and shall forget them nevermore!</li>
<li>Let the gods come to the offering,</li>
<li>But let not Enlil come to the offering,</li>
<li>Because he took not thought and made the cyclone,</li>
<li>And delivered my people over to destruction.</li></b></p></div></div>

<p><b>N. Anger of Enlil</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>Now when Enlil came nigh</li>
<li> He saw the ship; then was Enlil wroth</li>
<li>And he was filled with anger against the gods, the Igigi saying:</li><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<li>Hath any being escaped with his life?</li>
<li>He shall not remain alive, a man among the destruction</li></b></p></div></div>

<p><b>O. Speech of En-Urta</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>Then En-urta opened his mouth and spake</li>
<li>And said unto the warrior Enlil:</li> <div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<li>Who besides the god Ea can make a plan?</li>
<li>The god Ea knoweth everything that is done.</li>
<li>The god Ea opened his mouth and spake</li>
<li>And said unto the warrior Enlil,</li>
<li>O Prince among the gods, thou warrior,</li>
<li>How, how couldst thou, not taking thought, make a cyclone?</li>
<li>He who is sinful, on him lay his sin,</li>
<li>He who transgresseth, on him lay his transgression.</li>
<li>But be merciful that everything be not destroyed be long-suffering that man be not blotted out.</li>
<li>Instead of thy making a cyclone,</li>
<li>Would that the lion had come and diminished mankind.</li>
<li>Instead of thy making a cyclone</li>
<li>Would that the wolf had come and diminished mankind.</li>
<li>Instead of thy making a cyclone</li>
<li>Would that a famine had arisen and laid waste the land.</li>
<li>Instead of thy making a cyclone</li>
<li>Would that Irra, the Plague god, had risen up and laid waste the land.</li>
<li>As for me I have not revealed the secret of the great gods.</li>
<li>I made Atra-hasis to see a vision, and thus he heard the secret of the gods.</li>
<li>Now therefore take counsel concerning him.</li></b></p></div></div>
