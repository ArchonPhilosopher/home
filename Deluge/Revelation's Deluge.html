<h2>Revelation 6  <span style="font-size: 75%; padding-left: 33px;">The Four Horsemen</span></h2>

            
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>6:1</b></p>
</div>            
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:2</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:3</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:4</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:5</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:6</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:7</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:8</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:9</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: </b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:10</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? </b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:11</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:12</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; </b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:13</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:14</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:15</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; </b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:16</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: </b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;"><p><b>6:17</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? </b></p></div>



<h2>Revelation 8 <span style="font-size: 75%; padding-left: 33px;">Seven Angels with Seven Trumpets</span></h2>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:1</b></p>
</div>            
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:2</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:3</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:4</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:5</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:6</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:7</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:8</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; </b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:9</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:10</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; </b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:11</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:12</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>8:13</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound! </b></p></div>





<h2>Revelation 9</h2>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:1</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. </b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:2</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:3</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:4</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:5</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:6</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:7</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:8</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:9</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:10</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:11</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:12</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:13</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, </b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:14</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:15</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:16</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:17</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:18</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:19</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:20</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: </b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>9:21</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</b></p></div>


<h2>Revelation 11</h2>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>11:15</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>11:16</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, </b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>11:17</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>11:18</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>11:19</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</b></p></div>


<h2>Revelation 14  <span style="font-size: 75%; padding-left: 33px;">Son of Man and the Sickles</span></h2>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>14:14</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>14:15</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>14:16</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>14:17</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>14:18</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>14:19</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>14:20</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</b></p></div>







<h2>Revelation 16 <span style="font-size: 75%; padding-left: 33px;">Seven Angels with Seven Vials</span></h2>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>16:1</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>16:2</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>16:3</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>16:4</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>16:5</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>16:6</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>16:7</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>16:8</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</b></p></div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>16:9</b></p>
</div><div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.</b></p></div>
