<p><b>The Creator Goddess Thinks About Humankind</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>

[Nintur was paying attention:]
<li>Let me bethink myself of my humankind, all forgotten as they are;</li>
<li>and mindful of mine, Nintur's, creatures let me bring them back,</li>
<li>let me lead the people back from their trails.</li>
<li>Let they come and build cities and cult places,</li>
<li>that I may cool myself in their shade;</li>
<li>may they lay the bricks for the cult cities in pure spots,</li>
<li>and may they found places for divination in pure spots!"</li>
<li>She gave directions for purification, and cries for clemency,</li>
<li>the things that cool divine wrath,</li>
<li>perfected the divine service and the august offices,</li>
<li>said to the surrounding regions: "Let me institute peace there!"</li>

<li>When An, Enlil, Enki, and Ninhursaga</li>
<li>fashioned the dark-headed people,</li>
<li>they had made the small animals that came up from out of the earth</li>
<li>come from the earth in abundance and had let there be, as befits it,</li>
<li>gazelles, wild donkeys, and four-footed beasts in the desert.</li></b></p></div>

<ol start="32">

<p><b>Creation of kingship</b></p>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li> ... "and let me have him advise;</li>
<li>let me have him oversee their labor,</li>
<li>and let him teach the nation to follow like unerringly like cattle!"</li>

<li>When the royal scepter was coming down from heaven,</li>
<li>the august crown and the royal throne being already down from heaven,</li>
<li>the king regularly performed to perfection</li>
<li>the august divine services and offices,</li>
<li>and laid the bricks of those cities in pure spots.</li>
<li>They were named by name and allotted half-bushel baskets.</li></b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>The first cities</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>

<li>The firstling of the cities, Eridu, she gave to the leader Nudimmud,</li>
<li>the second, Bad-Tibira, she gave to the Prince and the Sacred One,</li>
<li>the third, Larak, she gave to Pahilsag,</li>
<li>the fourth, Sippar, she gave to the gallant Utu,</li>
<li>the fifth, Å uruppak, she gave to Ansud.</li>
<li>These cities, which had been named by names,</li>
<li>and had been alloted half-bushel baskets,</li>
<li>dredged the canals, which were blocked with purplish</li>
<li>wind-borne clay, and they carried water,</li>
<li>Their cleaning of the canals established abundant growth</li>

<p><b>Enki Intervenes</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>That day, Nintur wept over her creatures</li>
<li>And holy Inanna was full of grief over her people.</li>
<li>But Enki took counsel with his own heart.</li>
<li>An, Enlil, Enki, and Ninhursaga</li>
<li>had the gods of heaven and earth swear by the names of An and Enlil.</li></b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>Ziusudra's Vision</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>At that time Ziusudra was king and lustration priest.</li>
<li>He fashioned, being a seer, the god of giddiness</li>
<li>and stood in awe beside it, wording his wishes humbly.</li>
<li>As he stood there regularly day after day,</li>

<li>Something that was not a dream was appearing: conversation,</li>
<li>A swearing of oaths by heaven and earth, a touching of throats,</li>
<li>And the gods bringing their thwarts up to Kiur.</li></b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>Enki's advice</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>And as Ziusudra stood there beside it, he went on hearing:</li>
<li>"Step up to the wall to my left and listen!</li>
<li>Let me speak a word to you at the wall and may you grasp what I say.</li>
<li>May you heed my advice! By our hand a flood will sweep over</li>
<li>the cities of the half-bushel baskets, and the country.</li>
<li>The decision that mankind is to be destroyed has been made.</li>
<li>A verdict, a command of the assembly, can not be revoked.</li>

<li>No order of An and Enlil is known to have been countermanded.</li>
<li>Their kingship, their term, has been uprooted; they must bethink themselves.</li>
<li>Now listen</li>
<li>What I have said to you."</li></b></p></div>

<p><b>The Flood</b></p>

<p><b>
<li>All the evil winds, all stormy winds gathered into</li>
<li>one and with them. The Flood was sweeping over the cities of the half-bushel baskets,</li>
<li>for seven days and seven nights.</li>
<li>After the flood had swept over the country,</li>
<li>after the evil wind had tossed the big boat about on the great waters,</li>
<li>the sun came out spreading light over heaven and earth.</li></b></p></div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>Ziusudra's sacrifice</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>Ziusudra then drilled an opening in the big boat</li>
<li>and the gallant Utu sent his light into the interior of the big boat.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="140">
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>
<li>Ziusudra, being the king,</li>
<li>stepped up before Utu kissing the ground before him.</li>
<li>The king was butchering oxen, was being lavish with the sheep,</li>
<li>barley cakes, crescents together with victuals</li>
<li>This he was serving for him</li>
<li>
<li>With juniper, the pure plant of the mountains he filled on the fire</li>
<li>and with a hand clasped to</li>
<li>the breast he gave thanks.</li></b></p></div>

<li>"You here have sworn by the life's breath of heaven, the life's breath of earth that he verily is allied with you yourself.</li>
<li>You there, An and Enlil, have sworn by the life's breath of heaven, the life's breath of earth, that he is allies with all of you.</li>
<li>He will disembark the small animals that come up from the earth!"</li></b></p></div>

<p><b>Reward of Ziusudra</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b><div></div>
<li>Ziusudra, being king, stepped up before An and Enlil, kissing the ground,</li>
<li>and An and Enlil after honoring him</li>
<li>were granting life like a god's,</li>
<li>were making lasting breath of life, like a god's, descend into him.</li>
<li>That day they made Ziusudra, preserver, as king,</li>
<li>of the small animals and the seed of mankind,</li>
<li>live toward the east over the mountains of Dilmun.</li></b></p></div>
