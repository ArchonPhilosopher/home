<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>Erra (Nergal) speaking:</b></p>
</div>



            
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Like the sun, I scan the circumference of the world,</b></p>
<p><b>I am the wild ram striding forth in the steppe,</b></p>
<p><b>I invade the range and take up my dwelling in the fold,</b></p>
<p><b>All the gods are afraid of a fight, so the black-headed folk are contemptuous!</b></p>
<p><b>As for me, since they did not fear my name, </b></p>
<p><b>and I have disregarded Marduk´s command,</b></p>            
<p><b>so he may act according to his wishes I will make Marduk angry,</b></p>
<p><b> stir him from his dwelling, and lay waste the people !</b></p>

<BR><BR>

<p><b>The warrior Erra set out for Babylon, city of the king of the gods.</b></p>
<p><b>He entered Esagila, the temple of Marduk and the palace of heaven and earth, and stood before him.</b></p>
<p><b>He made ready to speak, saying to the king of the gods:</b></p>
<p><b>Why has your precious image, symbol of your lordship, lost its brilliance?</b></p>
<p><b>Your lordly diadem, which made the inner sanctum shine like the outside tower, why is it dimmed?</b></p>
</div>
<BR><BR>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>The king of the gods made ready to speak, saying to Erra, these words,</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>O warrior Erra, concerning that deed you said you would do,</b></p>
<p><b>Once, long ago indeed I grew angry, indeed I left my dwelling and caused the deluge!</b></p>
<p><b>When I left my dwelling, the regulation of heaven and earth disintegrated:</b></p>
<p><b>The shaking of heaven meant the positions of the heavenly bodies changed, nor did I restore them,</b></p>
<p><b>The quaking of netherworld meant the yield of the furrow diminished, being thereafter difficult to exploit.</b></p>
<p><b>The regulations of heaven and earth disintegrating meant underground water diminished, high water receded.</b></p>
<p><b>When I looked again, it was struggle to get enough.</b></p>
<p><b>Productivity of living offspring declined, nor did I renew it,</b></p>
<p><b>Such that were I a plowman, I could hold all seed in my hand.</b></p>
<p><b>I built another house and settled therein</b></p>
<BR><BR>



<p><b>As to my precious image, which had been struck by the deluge that its appearance was sullied,</b></p>
<p><b>I commanded fire to make my features shine and cleanse my apparel.</b></p>
<p><b>When it had shined my precious image and completed the task, I donned my lordly diadem and returned.</b></p>
<p><b>Haughty were my features, terrifying my glare!</b></p>
<p><b>The survivors of the deluge saw what was done,</b></p>
<p><b>Shall I raise my weapon and destroy the rest?</b></p>
<p><b>I sent those craftsmen down to the depths, I ordered them not to come up,</b></p>
<p><b>I removed the wood and gemstone and showed no one where,</b></p>

<BR><BR>


<p><b>Now then, warrior Erra, as concerns that deed you said you would do,</b></p>
<p><b>Where is the wood, flesh of the gods, suitable for the lord of the universe,</b></p>
<p><b>The sacred tree, splendid stripling, perfect for lordship,</b></p>
<p><b>Whose roots thrust down an hundred leagues through the waters of the vast ocean to the depths of hell,</b></p>
<p><b>Whose crown brushed Anu´s heaven on high?</b></p>
<p><b>Where is the clear gemstone that I had reserved for them?</b></p>
<p><b> Where is Ninildum's righteous due, great carpenter of my supreme divinity,</b></p>
<p><b>Wielder of the glittering hatchet, who knows that tool,</b></p>
<p><b>Who makes it shine like the day and puts it in subjection at my feet?</b></p>
<p><b>Where is Kunig-banda's due, fashioner of god and man, whose hands are sacred?</b></p>
<p><b>Where is Ninagal's due, wielder of the upper and lower millstone</b></p>
<p><b>Who grinds up hard copper like hide and who forges tools?</b></p>
<p><b>Where are the choice stones, created by the vast sea, to ornament my diadem?</b></p>
<p><b>Where are the seven sages of the depths, those sacred fish,</b></p>
<p><b>who, like Ea, Enki, their lord, are perfect in sublime wisdom, the ones who cleansed my person?</b></p>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>The warrior Erra heard him…..</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>He made ready to speak, saying to noble Marduk, craftsmen,</b></p>
<p><b>Tree and clear gemstone from its place will I bring up.</span></span></p>
<BR><BR>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>When Marduk heard this, he made ready to speak, saying to the warrior Erra:</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>When I rise from my dwelling, the regulation of heaven and earth will disintegrate,</b></p>
<p><b>The waters will rise and sweep over the land,</b></p>
<p><b>Bright day will turn to darkness, whirlwind will rise and the stars of heaven will stir</b></p>
<p><b>Ill winds will blow and the eyesight of living creatures will be darkened,</b></p>
<p><b>Demons will raise up and seize their rewards,</b></p>
<p><b>They will wreak havoc on any unarmed one who confronts them!</b></p>
<p><b>The gods of hell will rise up and smite down living creatures,</b></p>
<p><b>Who will keep them at bay till I gird on my weaponry once more?</b></p>

<BR><BR>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>When Erra heard this, he made himself ready to speak, saying to noble Marduk:</b></p>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>O noble Marduk, while you enter the house, fire cleanses your apparel and you return to your palace,</b></p>
<p><b>For that time I will govern and keep strong the regulation of heaven and earth,</b></p>
<p><b>I will go up to heaven and issue instructions to the Igigi gods, the Anunnaki, for space of the transport of goods</b></p>
<p><b>I will go down to the depths and keep the Anunna gods in order.</b></p>
<p><b>I will dispatch the wild demons to the netherworld,</b></p>
<p><b>I will brandish my fierce weaponry against them,</b></p>
<p><b>I will truss the wings of the ill wind like a bird’s.</b></p>
<p><b>At that house you shall enter, O noble Marduk ,</b></p>
<p><b>I will station Anu and Enlil to the right and left, like bulls.</b></p>
<BR><BR>
</div>

<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>Noble Marduk heard him, and the words which Erra spoke pleased him. …”</b></p>
