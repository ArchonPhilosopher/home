<div style="padding-left: 25px;">
<p><b>RAGING STORMS, evil gods are they</b></p>
</div>



            
<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Ruthless demons, who in heaven's vault were created, are they</b></p>
<p><b>Workers of evil are they</b></p>
<p><b>They lift up the head to evil, every day to evil</b></p>
<p><b>Destruction to work.</b></p>

<BR>

<p><b>Of these seven the first is the South wind.</b></p>
<p><b>The second is a dragon, whose mouth is opened, that none can measure.</b></p>
<p><b>The third is a grim leopard, which carries off the young.</b></p>
<p><b>The fourth is a terrible Shibbu.</b></p>
<p><b>The fifth is a furious Wolf, who knoweth not to flee.</b></p>
<p><b>The sixth is a rampant ... which marches against god and king.</b></p>
<p><b>The seventh is a storm, an evil wind, which takes vengeance.</b></p>

<BR>

<p><b>Seven are they, messengers to King Anu are they</b></p>
<p><b>From city to city darkness work they</b></p>
<p><b>A hurricane, which mightily hunts in the heavens, are they</b></p>
<p><b>Thick clouds, that bring darkness in heaven, are they</b></p>
<p><b>Gusts of wind rising, which cast gloom over the bright day, are they</b></p>
<p><b>With the Imkhullu the evil wind, forcing their way, are they</b></p>
<p><b>The overflowing of Adad mighty destroyers, are they</b></p>
<p><b>At the right of Adad stalking, are they</b></p>
<p><b>In the height of heaven, like lightning flashing, are they</b></p>
<p><b>To wreak destruction forward go they</b></p>
<p><b>In the broad heaven, the home of Anu, the King, evilly do they arise, and none to oppose.</b></p>
<BR>


<p><b>When Enlil heard these tidings, a plan in his heart he pondered</b></p>
<p><b>With Ea, exalted Massu of the gods, he took counsel.</b></p>
<p><b>Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar, whom he had set to order the vault of heaven</b></p>
<p><b>With Anu he divided the lordship of the whole heaven</b></p>
<p><b>To these three gods, his offspring</b></p>
<p><b>Day and night, without ceasing, he ordained to stand</b></p>
<p><b>When the seven evil gods stormed the vault of heaven</b></p> 
<p><b>Before the gleaming Sin, they set themselves angrily</b></p>
<p><b>The mighty Shamash, Adad the warrior, they brought on their side</b></p>
<p><b>Ishtar, with Anu the King, moved into a shining dwelling, exercising dominion over the heavens.</b></p>


<BR>


<p><b>Day and night he was dark (Sin), in the dwelling of his dominion he sat not down</b></p>
<p><b>The evil gods, the messengers of Anu, the King, are they</b></p>
<p><b>Raising their evil heads, in the night shaking themselves, are they</b></p>
<p><b>Evil searching out, are they</b></p>
<p><b>From the heaven, like a wind, over the land rush they.</b></p>
<p><b>Enlil saw the darkening of the hero Sin in heaven</b></p>
<p><b>The lord spoke to his minister Nusku</b></p>
<p><b>â€œO My minister Nusku, my message unto the ocean bring</b></p>
<p><b>The tidings of my son Sin, who in heaven has been sadly darkened</b></p>
<p><b>Unto Ea, in the ocean, announce it."</b></p></b></p>
            

<BR>

<p><b>Nusku exalted the word of his lord</b></p>
<p><b>To Ea, in the ocean, he went quickly</b></p>
<p><b>To the prince, the exalted Massu the lord Nudimmud.</b></p>
<p><b>Nusku, the word of his lord there announced Ea in the ocean heard that word.</b></p>
<p><b>He bit his lip and filled his mouth with wailing.</b></p> 
<p><b>Ea called his son Marduk, and gave to him the message:</b></p>








<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>"Go, my son Marduk</b></p>
<p><b>Son of a prince, the gleaming Sin has been sadly darkened in heaven</b></p>
<p><b>His darkening is seen in the heavens</b></p>
<p><b>The seven evil gods, death-dealing, fearless are they</b></p>
<p><b>The seven evil gods, like a flood, rush on, the land they fall upon, do they</b></p>
<p><b>Against the land, like a storm, they rise, do they</b></p>
<p><b>Before the gleaming Sin, they set themselves angrily;</b></p>
<p><b>The mighty Shamash, Adad the warrior, they brought on their side."</b></p>

<p><b>Destructive storms and evil winds are they</b></p> 
<p><b>A storm of evil, presaging the baneful storm</b></p>
<p><b>A storm of evil, forerunner of the baneful storm. Mighty children, mighty sons are they</b></p> 
<p><b>Messengers of Namtar are they, Throne-bearers of Ereshkigal. </b></p>
<p><b>The flood driving through the land are they. Seven gods of the wide heavens</b></p> 
<p><b>Seven gods of the broad earth</b></p> 
<p><b>Seven robber-gods are they.</b></p> 
<p><b>Seven gods of universal sway, Seven evil gods</b></p>

</div>

<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Neither male nor female are they. </b></p>
<p><b>Destructive whirlwinds they</b></p>
<p><b>Having neither wife nor offspring. </b></p>
<p><b>Compassion and mercy they do not know. </b></p>
<p><b>Prayer and supplication they do not hear.</b></p> 
<p><b>Horses reared in the mountains, Hostile to Ea. </b></p>
<p><b>Throne-bearers of the gods are they. </b></p>
<p><b>Standing on the highway, befouling the street. </b></p>

<p><b>III</b></p>
</div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>The high enclosures, the broad enclosures like a flood they pass through.</b></p>
<p><b>From house to house they dash along.</b></p>
<p><b>No door can shut them out</b></p>
<p><b>No bolt can turn them back.</b></p>
<p><b>Through the door, like a snake, they glide</b></p>
<p><b>Through the hinge, like the wind, they storm.</b></p>
<p><b>Tearing the wife from the embrace of the man</b></p>
<p><b>Snatching the child from the knees of a man</b></p>
<p><b>Driving the freedman from his family home.</b></p>

<p><b>CHARM AGAINST THE SEVEN EVIL SPIRITS</b></p></div>


<div style="padding-left: 65px;">
<p><b>Seven are they, seven are they!</b></p>
<p><b>In the channel of the deep seven are they!</b></p>
<p><b>In the radiance of heaven seven are they!</b></p>
<p><b>In the channel of the deep in a palace grew they up.</b></p>
<p><b>Male they are not, female they are not.</b></p>
<p><b>In the midst of the deep are their paths.</b></p>
<p><b>Wife they have not, son they have not.</b></p>
<p><b>Order and kindness know they not.</b></p>
<p><b>Prayer and supplication hear they not.</b></p>
<p><b>The cavern in the mountain they enter.</b></p>
<p><b>Unto Hea are they hostile.</b></p>
<p><b>The throne-bearers of the gods are they.</b></p>
<p><b>Disturbing the lily in the torrents are they set.</b></p>
<p><b>Baleful are they, baleful are they.</b></p>
<p><b>Seven are they, seven are they, seven twice again are they.</b></p>
<p><b>May the spirits of heaven remember, may the spirits of earth remember.</b></p>
