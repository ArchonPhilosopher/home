<H1 style="font-size: 2.4em; padding-left: 2em;">Obelisks: Symbols of Ptah, Demiurge of Egypt, Originary Collapser of the Wave-function, Ruler of the Worlds</h1>

<p class="intro">
<span style="font-size: 28px; ">The word <i>obelisk</i></span> is of Greek origin and means a ‘small spit’. Appearing first in ancient Egypt, obelisks are a symbol of Ptah, the first named <span class="tooltiplarge"><span class="tooltiptextlarge">Demiurge is a species able to collapse an originary universal wave-function into a real universe, a feature of the universe revealed in the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment</span><em>Demiurge</em></span>. They came to reflect great power, such as of the spirit of the Sun. Placed in pairs near the most important of temples, the tens-of-meters high monuments showed the greatness of a pharaoh’s power and inspired awe in his subjects. They are shaped as vertical tetrahedral, four-faced, columns, sculptured from a single piece of stone, narrowing upwards and ending with a pyramidal summit, a pyramidion.



<span class="city2" style="margin-left: 33px; background-color:clear; width:40px; height:40px; display: inline-block;"> &nbsp;</span></p>


<blockquote>
The ancient Egyptians were highly skilled in art and architecture and were masters of stone-working. Projects big or small were conducted with great care and were believed to be under the guidance of the great god Ptah. The Giza Plateau, which houses the great pyramids, is located just outside the ancient city of Memphis and well within the influence of Ptah. Additionally, the earlier step pyramid of Djoser was constructed under direction from the famed architect Imhotep, who is said to have been the son of the ancient god.   <span class="small"> --  https://www.thecollector.com/egyptian-god-ptah/</span></blockquote>


<p class="intro">Myths talk about Ptah rising out of the primeval water (the Nun) on a piece of rock or land called Ta-tenen, or "the first earth." In ancient Egypt, Ta-tenen was symbolized in temples and monuments with a stone called a <i>benben</i>, a tall square pillar with a pyramid on top. The Greeks called these benben stones obelisks.<span class="small"> -- https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/mythology/ptah/gossip</span></p>

<p class="intro">The greatness of the ancient obelisks was also appreciated by Roman emperors. These traces of the extinct civilization and the symbols of the conquered countries were transferred to the capital of the Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages, neglected obelisks were restored on the squares of the Eternal City by pontiff decree. </p>

<p class="intro">In the nineteenth century, imperical powers France, Britain, and America  transported these symbols of power onto their territories, as monuments and testaments to mastery of the world. Today, the extant centers of power within the Wider Western Civilization each contain that signal to the species that rule: Washington D.C., the City of London, Vatican City. Whether through accidental adherence to ancient esoteric homage, these three centers and others erect the symbol of the <i>Pleroma</i>, that overflowing emptiness out of which arises all things; that location clearly identified within the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment as looking into the future. </p>

<p class="intro">More than two thousand obelisks exported from out of ancient Egypt remain. </p>

About 1475 BC at the direction of Pharaoh Thutmose III, two granite obelisks were placed in front of the Temple of Ra in the Egyptian city of <span class="tooltip"><a name="cityofthesun"><span class="tooltiptext">City of the Sun</span>Heliopolis</a></span>. During the Roman era, both steles had been transported to <span class="tooltip"><a name="cityoftruth"><span class="tooltiptext">City of Truth</span>Alexandria</a></span>, and had been standing in Kesarium – the temple built by Cleopatra in honor of Marcus Antonius. The hieroglyphs on the pillar’s sides contain the symbols of Thutmose III and songs of praise to the ‘son of the sun god’; later Ramesses II added his name to them. In 1878, the obelisk appeared on the Victoria Embankment in <span class="tooltip"><a name="cityofduty"><span class="tooltiptext">City of Duty</span>London</a></span>. The complicated transportation of the 21-meter monolith weighing 224 tons was paid by English surgeon Sir Erasmus Wilson.</p>

As soon as newspapers reported the transportation of the new obelisk to Britain, Americans got inflamed with the idea of having the second ‘needle’. The expensive transportation of the monolith (224 tons) and the pedestal (50 tons) was paid by the magnate W. Vanderbilt. After the traditional Mason corner-stone was laid in the foundation, the obelisk was mounted in the <span class="tooltip"><a name="cityofactivity"><span class="tooltiptext">City of Activity</span>New York City</a></span> Central Park (1881). As far back as Romans transported the obelisk to <span class="tooltip"><a name="cityoftruth"><span class="tooltiptext">City of Truth</span>Alexandria</a></span>, they damaged the base – that’s why ancient masters cast from bronze four crab-bearings, 400 kg each. Today the two surviving original figures are kept in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and those are replaced by copies.

Two more obelisks created in Thutmose III’s reign were mounted near the Temple of <span class="tooltip"><a name="cityof??"><span class="tooltiptext">City of ??</span>Karnak</a></span> in 1460 BC in honor of his 30 years on the throne. The inscriptions on the sides praise the ruler’s victories in Mesopotamia. In 357 AD, at Emperor Constantius II’s will both pillars were moved to <span class="tooltip"><a name="cityoftruth"><span class="tooltiptext">City of Truth</span>Alexandria</a></span>, to celebrate the 20 years of his reign. Initially the steles were enormous – almost 38 meters high and 543 tons each. In 390, Emperor Theodosius I ordered to transfer the first stone to <span class="tooltip"><a name="cityofwealth"><span class="tooltiptext">City of Wealth</span>Constantinople</a></span>. Being transported it split, and only a fragment survived – 20 meters high and with weight 282 tons – which was mounted onto the 6-meter marble pedestal in the center of the race track, now the Istanbul Sultanahmet Square.

In 1588, the obelisk was mounted opposite the Lateran basilica on the pedestal and decorated with a cross, accounting this for the memory of the Christian emperor Constantine. Although some fragments were lost, the pillar remains the highest obelisk of Ancient Egypt in the world – the granite monolith with weight 330 tons rises up to 37 meters.

Pharaoh Ramesses II was noted not only for his inscriptions on other monuments, but also for creating his own ones. About 1300 BC, a couple of columns were placed in front of the Temple Amon-Ra in <span class="tooltip"><a name="cityof??"><span class="tooltiptext">City of ??</span>Luxor</a></span>. The sides are inscribed with praise words to the ruler, who proclaimed himself to be the son of the sun god Ra.

Another pair of obelisks named after Ramesses II decorated the main Temple of God Atum, the patron of <span class="tooltip"><a name="cityofthesun"><span class="tooltiptext">City of the Sun</span>Heliopolis</a></span>, 1300 BC. In the first century AD these not too high columns were transported to <span class="tooltip"><a name="theeternalcity"><span class="tooltiptext">The Eternal City</span>Rome</a></span> by Emperor Domitian and placed in the Temple of Isis. In the 16th century, one stele was bought by Cardinal Ferdinand Medici for his Roman villa.

On the top of the monolith there is a gilded sphere, on the pedestal under it there are four turtles. The inscriptions praise Ramesses, calling him the ‘beloved son of Atum and Ra’.</p>

The Flaminio obelisk was built during the reign of the pharaohs Ramesses II and Merneptah <i>circa</i> 1300 BCE. It stood in the Temple of the Sun in the city of <span class="tooltip"><a name="cityofthe sun"><span class="tooltiptext">City of the Sun</span>Heliopolis</a></span>. In 10 AD, it was brought to <span class="tooltip"><a name="theeternalcity"><span class="tooltiptext">The Eternal City</span>Rome</a></span> by command of Emperor Octavius Augustus, together with the Obelisk of Montecitorio. Like the Lateran Obelisk, it stood in the Circus Maximus, and was found together with the latter among the ruins split into three fragments. On the order of Pope Sixtus V it was restored by the architect Domenico Fontana and mounted on the square Piazza del Popolo in 1589. The Egyptian obelisk is 24 meters high, weighing 235 tons; the total height of the monument together with the cross and base equals 36.5 meters. The hieroglyphs contain the names of Ramesses II and his son Merneptah.</p>

The ruler decided to have it made as a gnomon for a gigantic sun-dial. Before the obelisk had belonged to Pharaoh Psammetichus II from the Saite Dynasty, who had been on the Egyptian throne in 595-589 BC. Approximately in the 10th century the obelisk fell down and was covered with rubbish. The fragments of the Roman sun-dial were discovered in 1502, however it was restored completely only in 1793 by command of Pope Pius VI. The architect D. Antinori restored the obelisk-gnomon on Piazza di Montecitorio. Nevertheless, the sun-dial shows wrong time.
