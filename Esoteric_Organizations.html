<P>The Aetherius Society is a religious movement founded by George King (1919 - 1997), in the mid-1950s as the result of what King claimed 
were contacts with extra-terrestrial intelligences, whom he referred to as ‘Cosmic Masters’.&nbsp; The main goal of the believer is to contact 
these Cosmic Masters, who may help humanity solve its current Earthly problems and later allow them a place in the world to come.</p>
<p>It is a UFO centered syncretic religion, based primary on <i>Perrenial Philosophy</i> approach,
 but also incorporating New Age ideas.&nbsp; Members meet in congregations similar to a church.&nbsp; The religion 
emphasises altruism, community service, nature worship, spiritual healing, and physical exercise, and can be considered to have relatively
 conventional ideas since its members come from mainstream society.&nbsp; Membership, although international in composition, is not very large.</p>

<p>George Cecil Jones (1873 - 1960 CE) was the man responsible for introducing Aleister Crowley (1875 - 1947) to the <a href="#gd">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (G.D.)</a>
 in 1898.&nbsp; Crowley soon became an ardent supporter of GD leader Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, but for various 
reasons, Crowley lost faith in the order and in 1907 with the help of Jones decided to found the Astrum Argentum A &#8756; A &#8756;.</p>
<p>When Crowley became the leader of the <a href="#ordotempliorientis">Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.)</a>, it became the outer order of 
the A &#8756; A &#8756;. The emblem incorporates the symbols of the A &#8756; A &#8756;  and the O.T.O.&nbsp; The outer portion, known as the septagram, is the 
symbol of the outer order, representing the ceiling of the Vault of the Adepti (5=6 grade, G.D.), and the symbol of Babalon, a known holy name of Binah, corresponding with the High 
Priestess of the Tarot, whose title in Thelemic Tarot decks is 
'Priestess of the Silver Star'.&nbsp;  Babalon is 'To Mega Therion' (The Great Beast), whose duty was to help manifest materialistic energies of the current Aeon of Horus.</p>
<P>Using the Hebrew system of Gematria, Babalon enumerates to 156.&nbsp; Crowley devised a 
mathematical formula containing seven sevens to represent this number:
<br></p><img src="archonphilosopherhomepagefiles/crowleyformula.gif">
<p>Unlike the A &#8756; A &#8756;, the G.D. was primarily a teaching order, preparing people to do 
magic in its 'Inner Order'.&nbsp; The A &#8756; A &#8756;  on the other hand, assumed that its members were either already trained
 or were receiving training from their immediate superior.
</p><p>Subsequent to Crowley's death in 1947, several individuals claimed to 
continue the order, with some lineages being very clear while others are very much open to debate.

<td class="content">
<P>The Book of Ages is a metaphysical treatise written by Andrew Twohig detailing a multi-consciousness ontology and perhaps the first ever non-magical metaphysics. 
Based upon the repeated findings of the <em>Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment</em> and the <em>Double Slit Experiment</em>, the <em>Book of Ages</em> details a starkly different universe, created and directed by a Demiurgic species which has over time created a Type III Civilization. Earth is but one node of many within this expanding but compact universe. </p>

<p> Central in this post-Heideggerian analysis is the "clearing"/field of experience, which is formed with the necessary collapse of a universal wave-function from the "overhang of pre-time", a
possible ontological location visible in the <em>Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment</em>. The equiprimordial <em>Laws of Physical Nature</em> surround/interpentrate this clearing to allow for experience, while themselves not accessible within the world. As such, as human consciousness attempts to understand each Law, the further along this pathway, the stranger the findings become, leading to the notion of unfinalizability. The Book of Ages also touches upon history as a Experiential Topology as regards the 6,000 year <em>Demiurgic</em> and <em>Archonic</em> (aliens/Watchers/Nephilim/Guardians/gods) interventions into human affairs, as recently admitted to in the <i>Tic Tac</i> and <i>Gimbal</i> incidents, but as repeatedly witnessed by perhaps 10's of million of people living today, most notably in the Black Triangle events in Belguim, Arizona, and New York state.</p>

<p>Within the analysis is a recognition of a <em>double deception</em> that 1) humans are structurally misled about the lights in the sky in a necessary effort to allow full 
belief in the lights as real in order to allow human collapse of a wave-function of that belief, and 2) humans are misled about their being a "junior Archon" with immense formative powers of the collapse of wave-functions in an effort to maintain human false beliefs.   Despite this <em>double deception</em>, it is likely that all Archons went along a similar path of providing resources and then becoming aware of their natures and arising across spans of time into a more full participation in the Type III Civilization and management of the multitude of existing and emerging nodes.</p>

<p>The Latter-day Saint movement was begun
 by Joseph Smith (1805 - 1844) in New York State during the 
1820s upon transcribing the <i>Book of Mormon</i>. After Smith's assassination in 1844, many Mormons -as they were called - moved to 
the Utah Territory, now the centre of Mormon cultural influence, fractioning into a number of different churches in the process.  
Today, most Mormons are understood to be members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).</p>

<p> Smith claimed that angel Moroni had directed him to Golden Plates, and with scrying tools of “Urim and Thummim”, he translated the text on the Plates into English. 
Despite outside claims to the contrary, Mormons identify as Christians and believe that  Christ's church was restored through Joseph Smith and is guided by living prophets and apostles.</p>

With the publication of <i>The Book of the SubGenius</i> in 1983, the Church of the SubGenius prophesied that its founder, J.R.

<p>The Confraternity of the Rose Cross (CR+C) is a Rosicrucian organisation founded by former <a href="#amorc">AMORC</a> Imperator Gary L. Stewart (born 1953) in 1996 CE. Stewart also 
founded the 'Order Militia Crucifera Evangelica' and the 'British <a href="#martinistorder">Martinist</a> Order'. </p>
<p>The CR+C is active in the USA, the UK, Brazil, Australia and several other countries, using the earliest version of the Rosicrucian 
Monographs as written by Harvey Spencer Lewis (1883 - 1939), the founder of AMORC, and which were issued by that Order between 1915 and 1939.</p>
<p>Imperator Stewart often includes commentaries and, on occasions, additional monographs written by himself.&nbsp; According to Stewart, 
these earlier monographs preserve the unique philosophical and spiritual contributions of Harvey Spencer Lewis, many of which had been edited out of the AMORC monographs.</p>

<p>The Druze are an esoteric Muslim ethnoreligious group originating in Western Asia who uphold the unity of God, against creeping anthropomorphism.  Jethro of Midian is considered the ancestor of all Mandaeans and Mahra from Druze Mountain, who revere him as their spiritual founder and chief prophet.</p>
<p>The Druze faith is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion based on the teachings of high Islamic figures like Hamza ibn-Ali ibn-Ahmad and Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, along 
with Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates. The <i>Epistles of Wisdom</i> is the foundational text of the Druze 
faith, which incorporates elements of Islam's Ismailism, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, and Pythagoreanism, creating a distinct and esoteric theology that highlights the role of the mind and truthfulness.</p>
<p>The Druze follow theophany, and believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of the soul.&nbsp; At the end of the cycle of rebirth, 
which is achieved through successive reincarnations, the soul is united with the Cosmic Mind (Al Aaqal Al Kulli).</p>

<p>The Order of the Free and Accepted Masons is one of the largest global secret fraternal societies, originally stemming from mediaeval 
stone-crafter guilds, and claiming descent from the builders of King Solomon's Temple.&nbsp; It was founded on the notion that the 
architecture of a church (typically King Solomon's Temple) is a metaphor for the architecture of the soul and man's relationship with God.</p>
<p>George Oliver cites the etymology of the word "Mason" as <a href="esoteric_organization_files//IntheMidstofHeaven.png">"In the midst of heaven"</a>. 

<p>Freemasonry is a fraternal organisation whose individual members are united by shared ideals of both a moral and metaphysical nature and, in 
most of its branches, by a constitutional declaration of a belief in a Supreme Being.&nbsp; Organisationally, Freemasonry is governed on a 
geographical basis by independent, Sovereign Grand Lodges and Grand Orients which may, or may not be in a state of mutual recognition.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Scottish Order of Freemasons were established after several members of the Knights Templar fled there following its disbandment by Pope Clement V and King Henry of France.

<p>The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor (HBOL) was an initiatory occult organisation that first became public toward the end of 1894, 
although according to an alleged official document of the order it began its work in 1870. According to this document, authored by Peter 
Davidson (1842 - 1916), the order was established by Max Theon (1848 - 1927), who when in England was initiated as a Neophyte by ‘an adept of 
the serene, ever-existing and ancient Order of the original HBOL’. The Order's relationship, if any, to the mysterious ‘Brotherhood of 
Luxor’ that Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831 - 1891) spoke of is unclear.
<p>The order's teachings drew heavily from the sex-magic theories of Paschal Beverly Randolph 1825 - 1875), who influenced groups such as the
 <a href="#ordotempliorientis">Ordo Templi Orientis</a> (O.T.O.) (later headed by Aleister Crowley (1875 - 1947)) although it 
is not clear whether or not Randolph himself was actually a part of the Order.</p>
<p>Prior to the rise of the <a href="#gd">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a> in 1888, the HBOL was the only order teaching practical occultism
 in the Western Mystery Tradition. Among its members were a number of occultists, spiritualists, and Theosophists. Initial relations
 between the Order and the <a href="#theosophicalsociety">Theosophical Society</a> were cordial, with most members of one order also prominent members of the other.</p>
<p>Later there was a falling out, as the Order was opposed to the later eastern-based teachings of Blavatsky (Davidson considered she had fallen
 under the influence of ‘a greatly inferior Order belonging to the Buddhist Cult’). Conversely, the conviction for fraud in 1883 of 
the Secretary of the HBOL, Thomas Henry Burgoyne (1855 – 1894), was claimed by the Theosophists to show the immorality of the Order.</p>

<td class="content">
<p>The original 'Order of the Golden Dawn' (G.D.) was founded in London in 1887 as a magical fraternity by Dr William Wynn Westcott, a London 
physician and coroner. His partners were another physician, Dr William Robert Woodman, and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers. All 
three were <a href="#freemasonry">Freemasons</a>, although sometime after becoming a member, Macgregor Mathers became inactive in that field. Woodman headed a reputable <a href="#rosicrucianfellowship">Rosicrucian Fellowship</a>,
 its members being well respected, high ranking Masons in London. These three founder members were also members of an exclusive lodge, the
 <a href="#sria">Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (SRIA)</a>, founded in 1866 by the noted Grand Lodge Freemason Kenneth MacKenzie, author of <i>The Royal Masonic Encyclopaedia</i>.&nbsp; Members of the SRIA were required to be Christian.</p>
<p>Westcott, also a member of the <a href="#theosophicalsociety">Theosophical Society</a>, appears to have been the initial driving force behind establishing the 
G.D., while Woodman, as Supreme Magus of the SRIA, was probably recruited to lend credibility to the new organisation. Mathers was  an antiquarian, translator and researcher with a brilliant talent for 
composing ritual works and integrating occult symbolism. He also insisted that women be allowed to participate in the Order in 'equality' with men, unlike the men-only tradition of Masonry. The G.D. was 
open to any man or woman who professed a 'belief in a Supreme Being or Beings'.</p>
<p>According to its founders, the G.D. was based on a charter from a supposedly 'ancient German Rosicrucian Lodge', which had written the <i>Cipher Manuscripts</i> containing a coded 
record of their secret occult rituals. Westcott claimed he had acquired these mysterious manuscripts in 1886 from the effects of Reverend AFA Woodford, an elderly Masonic scholar. They were 
discovered amongst assorted papers of the Swedenborgian Rite that MacKenzie had bequeathed to Woodford after his death in 1886, which were passed to Westcott, in his capacity as an Officer of the SRIA, by 
Woodford's widow.</p>
<p>The Cipher Manuscripts also contained the address of an aged adept, 'Fräulein Sprengel', in Germany, to whom Westcott wrote inquiring about the contents of the papers. She responded, and after accepting the requests of Westcott and Mathers, issued them with a charter to operate  a Lodge of the Order in England. Westcott's first G.D. Temple was the Isis-Urania Lodge, styled 'No 3'.&nbsp; Temple No 1 would have been Fraulein Sprengel's lodge, and No 2 was reputedly an abortive attempt 
at a lodge by some unnamed persons in London.</p>
<p>Many celebrities belonged to the G.D., including the actress Florence Farr and the Irish revolutionary Maude Gonne.&nbsp; Some other 
well-known members included Arthur Machen, William Butler Yeats, and Aleister Crowley. The original Lodge founded in 1888, being more 
of a philosophical and metaphysical teaching Order, did not teach any magical practices as such, except for basic 'banishing rituals' and 
meditation. This was called the 'Outer Order', in which the G.D. existed for four years. The 'Inner Order', which only became 
active in 1892, comprised the circle of Adepts who had completed the entire course of study and initiations of the 'Outer Order' contained in
 the Cipher Manuscripts.&nbsp; This group became known as the 'Second Order', while the 'Outer Order' became the 'First Order'.</p>
<p>The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn fragmented in 1900-1901, and by 1906 disolved into four daughter organisations: 1) Alpha et Omega led by Mathers, 2) Stella Matutina; 3) the Isis-Urania Temple led by A. E. Waite; and 4) Aleister Crowley's A∴A∴.

<p>Kemetic Orthodoxy is a modern religious sect based on Kemeticism, a reconstruction of Egyptian polytheism, deriving from a 
spiritual lineage from the Ancient Egyptian religion. It was founded in 1988 by Tamara Siuda, born 1969, who remains its current 
Nisut or 'The One in Authority'. The main temple is in Joliet, Illinois, with a variety of state shrines maintained by priests throughout the world.
<p>Kemetic Orthodoxy does not follow a single scripture, but rather a fluid understanding of balance, justice and truth.&nbsp; Worship often takes 
place in shrines, which exist in both public and personal forms.</p>
<p>Five basic tenets guide the faith of members: belief in upholding Ma'at; belief in Netjer (the supreme being); Akhu (Ancestor) veneration; participation in and 
respect for the community; acknowledgment of Siuda as the Nisut. Members of the faith are known as 'Shemsu'.</p>

Military Order of Malta</i>, which remains a sovereign subject of international law. It was headquartered variously in Jerusalem, Rhodes and Malta, and currently in Rome.</p>
<p>The <i>Hospitallers</i> arose in the early 11<sup>th</sup> century in the Muristan district of Jerusalem dedicated to John the Baptist and founded by Benedictine Brother Gerard Thom to provide care for sick, poor or injured pilgrims coming and going from and to the Holy Land.</p>

The <i>Hospitallers</i> were the smallest sovereign to colonise parts of the Americas; at one point acquiring four Caribbean islands, which they ceded to the French in the 1660s.</p>

<p>The <i>Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon</i>, better known as the <i>Knights Templar</i> or simply <i>Templars</i>, was a Catholic 
military order recognised in 1139 by a papal bull <i>Omne Datum Optimum</i> of the Holy See. The <i>Templars</i> was founded in 1119 and active from about 1129 to 1312.</p>
<figurel><img src="esoteric_organization_files//knightstemplar2.gif" title="Knights Templar" align="left" width="100"></figurel>
<p>The <i>Templars</i> was among the wealthiest and most powerful of orders and soon became a favoured charity throughout Christendom and grew rapidly in membership 
and power. <i>Templar knights</i>, in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross, were among the most skilled fighting units of the 
Crusades. Non-combatant members of the order managed a large economic infrastructure, developing innovative financial techniques that
 in reality were an early form of banking, and building fortifications across Europe and the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The <i>Templars</i> were closely tied to the Crusades, so once the Holy Land had been lost to Europe, support for the order faded. Then rumours about 
their secret initiation ceremony began to circulate which created distrust in the order. King Philip IV of France -- deeply in debt 
to the Templars -- took advantage of the situation to gain control over them. In 1307, he had many of the order's members in France 
arrested on a Friday 13<sup>th</sup>, tortured into giving false confessions, and burned at the stake. The order was eventually disbanded by Pope Clement V in 1312 under pressure from King Philip.</p>
<p>The abrupt reduction in power of such a significant group in European society gave rise to speculation, legend, and legacy through the 
ages. The appropriation of their name by later organisations has kept the name 'Templar' alive to the present day, while helping to 
obscure its origin. People have speculated that <a href="#freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> originated from the Templars, many of whom, it is said, had fled to Scotland.</p>

<p>Martinism is a form of Christian mysticism and esoteric Christianity concerned with the fall of the first man, Adam, his state of privation from his divine source 

<figurel><img src="esoteric_organization_files//martinism_manuscriptdalger.png" title="Dalger Manuscript" align="middle" width="100"></a></figurel>

and the process of his return, called 'reintegration' or illumination. Adam, firstly, was created androgyne in order to create a spiritually perfect material being and secondly to watch over the fallen
angels the material world which was the prison into which those angels fell. Unfortunately, Adam got lost in his duties, and he himself fell into this prison which he had been instructed to 
watch over. He became a material and mortal being, and now must make an effort to save himself and all of the original creation.</p>
<p>As a mystical tradition, it was first transmitted through a <a href="#freemasonry">Masonic</a>
 high-degree system established around 1740 CE in France by Martinez de Pasqually (1727 - 1774), and later propagated in different forms by his 
two students Louis Claude de Saint-Martin (1743 - 1803) and Jean-Baptiste Willermoz (1730 - 1824). The <a href="esoteric_organization_files//martinism_manuscriptdalger.png">Dalger Manuscript</a> is a main document. </p>
<p>Confusingly, the term Martinism applies to both this particular doctrine and the teachings of the reorganised Martinist Order founded in 1886 by Augustin
 Chaboseau (1868 - 1946) and Gérard Encausse (Papus (1865 - 1916)), although it had not been used at the tradition's inception in the 18th 
century.&nbsp; This confusion is exacerbated was already also used interchangeably between the teachings of Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin and 
Martinez de Pasqually, with the works of the first often being attributed to the latter.</p>

<p>The Nation of Islam subscribes to the belief that UFOs are man-made machines that are piloted not by extraterrestrial beings, but by humans. It is believed that these machines will have a hand in the Day of Judgment. Its late leader Elijah Muhammed claimed that the biblical Book of Ezekiel describes a “Mother Plane” or great “Wheel”. Elijah reported in his books that his mentor, Wallace Fard Muhammad, claimed that there was hidden technology on the Earth which selected scientists all around the world are secretly aware of. Fard explained that he had had a huge "Mother Plane" or "Wheel" constructed on the island of Nippon (Japan) in 1929. </p>


<p>The movement’s current leader, Louis Farrakhan, describes the “Mother Plane” thus:</p>


<p style="padding-left: 2em; font-size: 80%;">
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad told us of a giant Motherplane that is made like the universe, spheres within spheres. White people call them unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Ezekiel, in the Old Testament, saw a wheel that looked like a cloud by day but a pillar of fire by night. The Hon. Elijah Muhammad said that that wheel was built on the island of Nippon, which is now called Japan, by some of the original scientists. It took 15 billion dollars in gold at that time to build it. It is made of the toughest steel. America does not yet know the composition of the steel used to make an instrument like it. It is a circular plane, and the Bible says that it never makes turns. Because of its circular nature it can stop and travel in all directions at speeds of thousands of miles per hour. He said there are 1,500 small wheels in this mother wheel which is a half mile by a half mile (800 by 800 m). This Mother Wheel is like a small human built planet. Each one of these small planes carry three bombs.</p>

 Hermann Fichtuld (c. 1700 - 1777). Candidates were expected to be Master Masons in good standing, with alchemy being a central study for members. Much of the hierarchical structure for this order was used by 
<a href="#sria">Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia</a> and from there, the <a href="#gd">Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</a>.
<p>Although the fraternity was founded in the 1750s, it is uncertain as to when it actually came into existence. Many documents and books from the 18th century mention it. For instance, Frater U∴D∴ believes that in 1710, the idea for the order was born with the publication <i>The perfect and true preparation of the Philosophers Stone according to the secret of the Brotherhoods of the Golden and Rosy Cross</i> by  of Sigmund Richter, under the name Sincerus Renatus.
<p> By the 1770s, the order had centres in Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Regensburg, Munich, Vienna, Prague, Poland, Hungary, and Russia. The most influential member of the Order was Prince Frederick-William, a
 future King of Prussia, but the order was to slowly decline after his death.</p>

Order with its Grand Lodge in Norway and jurisdictions in Sweden, United States, Canada, Argentina, Spain, Greece, and England, combining the various schools and customs of Martinism into one order and organises 
their philosophies into three separate paths to spiritual enlightenment: <ul><li> the Voie Cardiaque (Way of the Heart), with focus on inner meditation and symbolic interpretation</li> <li> 
the Chevaliers Bienfaisantes de la Cite Sainte, the knightly arm with focus on enlightenment through selfless actions and 
chivalrous heraldry</li><li>the third is Elus Coen, the heirs of the original magic practiced by Pasqually, with focus on learning spells that summon astral beings and bind demonic influences.</li></ul>

<p>The Prieuré de Sion, translated as <i>Priory of Sion</i>, is a fraternal organisation, founded in France by Pierre Plantard (1920 - 2000),  describing itself as the secret society founded by Godfrey of Bouillon (1060 - 1100) on Mount Zion in the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1099. </p>
<p>There is contention about the nature of this organization, with no denial by Plantard, but allegations supported by judge Thierry Jean-Pierre, an affiliate of French nationalist Philippe de Villiers, descendent of the Duke of Orléans,that the documents supporting the history of the Priory of Sion were fabricated. In Plantard's understanding, the <i>Priory</i> was devoted to installing a secret bloodline of the Merovingian dynasty on the thrones of France and the rest of Europe. This myth was expanded upon and popularised by the 1982 pseudohistorical book <i>The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail</i> and later claimed as factual in the preface of the 2003 novel <i>The Da Vinci Code.</i></p>

<p>Raëlism is an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) religion founded in 1974 by a then 28 year old Claude Vorilhon. In a claimed encounter with an extra-terrestrial, Vorilhon was told that  
life on Earth  was scientifically created by Elohim, a species of extra-terrestrials. The Raëlian movement promotes a future oriented uni-culture experience for humans, aligned with  friendly extra-terrestrials, 
if humans can escape their violent past.</p>

<p>It is the position of the <em>Archon Philosopher</em> that over the course of 6,000 years (and longer) there have been repeated attempts by various <em>Archons</em>, acting both with permission and without, understandably by the leadership of the Type III Civilization and non-understandably, and with human's best interests and without. <i>Hermeneutic exegesis</i> is needed to unravel the message attempted to be given, the message received, the message communicated, and then the message received by contemporary people and then by people today. For example, for Raëlism, the idea of creating a genetic set is understandable and thus if an Archon said to an ancient person that the creator of humans took a code from itself and adapted it, this would have not been easily expressible in terms we now can sum up as human DNA is geneticially modified from some Archon's DNA. This type of <i>hermeneutic exegesis</i> is required for all texts passed forward in time, including numbers for time and amounts and all manner of understandings. Taking one piece of information literally is likely to result in error; however, should a description of a past event be similar to current events, we may place both onto an Experiential Topology Should an experiential topology grow large enough then we are likely to have stumbled across an event which is intersubjectively verifiable across time. </p>

<td class="content">
<p>Rosicrucianism is a cultural movement which arose in Europe in the early 17<sup>th</sup> century following the publication of several esoteric texts influenced by Egyptian occultism, and combining references to Kabbalah, Hermeticism, Alchemy and mystical Christianity. Perhaps as back-dating, it is said to be founded in 1407 in Germany by 'Christian Rosenkreutz' as an <i>Inner Worlds Order</i>, composed of <i>Great Adepts</i>. A so-called <i>College of Invisibles</i> is regarded as the source permanently behind all development of the Rosicrucian movement.</p>
<p>In the 17<sup>th</sup> century three Rosicrucian Manifestos were published anonymously: <i>Fama Fraternitatis</i> in 1614, <i>Confessio Fraternitatis</i> in 1615 and the <i>Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz</i> in 1616. Together they presented a legend related to a German pilgrim named C.R.C., who was later, in the third Manifesto, introduced as Christian Rosenkreuz. The legend tells us that this pilgrim studied in the Middle East under various occult masters and founded the Rosicrucian Order, aimed at bringing about a 'universal reformation of mankind'. During his lifetime, the Order was alleged to be very small, consisting of no more than eight members; following his death, apparently in the 15<sup>th</sup> century, the Order disappeared, only to be 'reborn' in the early 17<sup>th</sup> century, at about the time the manifestos were published.</p>

<p>The foundation of the Order can be calculated as having occurred in the year 1407. However, these numbers (and deduced years) are not taken literally by many students of occultism, and are considered as 
allegorical and symbolic statements for the understanding of the initiated, the reason for which relies on the Manifestos themselves. On the one hand, the Rosicrucians clearly adopted, 
through the Manifestos, the Pythagorean tradition of seeing objects and ideas in terms of their numerical aspects, and, on the other hand, they state in the second Manifesto, <i>"We speak unto you by parables, but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy and ingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of all secrets".</i></p>
<p>By promising a spiritual transformation at a time of great turmoil, the manifestos tempted many figures to seek esoteric knowledge. Seventeenth-century occult philosophers such as Michael Maier (1568 - 1622), Robert Fludd (1574 - 1637), and Thomas Vaughan (1621 - 1666) interested themselves in the Rosicrucian world view. According to historian David Stevenson (born 1942), it was influential to <a href="#freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> which was emerging in Scotland. 
<p>In modern times, Rosicrucianism has fragmented into a number of competing organisations promoting variations of the same general occult themes. Those who study Rosicrucianism are known as Rosicrucians, 
whose greeting is, <i>"May the Roses bloom upon your Cross."</i></p>

<p>Stories of extraterrestrial civilizations and interventions in past lives form a part of the belief system of Scientology. The most
well-known story is that of Xenu, the ruler of the Galactic Confederacy who is said to
have brought billions of frozen people to Earth 75 million years ago, placed them near a number of volcanoes, and dropped
hydrogen bombs into them, thus killing the entire population in an effort to solve overpopulation. The spirits of these people were
then captured by Xenu and mass implanted with numerous suggestions and then “packaged” into clusters of spirits.</p>

<p>Scientology teaches that all humans have experienced innumerable past lives, including lives in ancient advanced extraterrestrial
societies, such as Helatrobus and the Marcabians. Traumatic memories from these past lives are said to be the cause of many
present-day physical and mental ailments. Scientologists also believe that human beings possess superhuman powers which cannot
be restored until they have been fully rehabilitated as spiritual beings through the practice of “auditing”, using methods set out by
Hubbard in his various works.</p>


<p>According to Hubbard, a thetan (the Scientology term for a soul) has a body. When that body dies the thetan goes to a “landing
station” on the planet Venus, where they are re-implanted and are programmed to forget their previous lifetimes. The Venusians
then “capsule” each thetan and send them back to Earth to be dumped into the Gulf of California; whereupon, each thetan searches
for a new body to inhabit. To avoid these inconveniences, Hubbard advised Scientologists to simply refuse to go to Venus after
their death.</p>

<p>Solar Lodge was a secret society in the United States. It was established in 1965 CE but withdrew into initiatory inactivity in 1972.

<p>The precursor to Solar Lodge was set in motion by Ray Burlingame (Frater Aquarius), when he initiated Georgina 'Jean' Brayton (Soror Capricornus) in 1962. Although Burlingame was a Ninth-Degree 
member of O.T.O., he did not hold a charter to initiate new members or found new bodies, consequently O.T.O. has never accepted Solar Lodge as a valid body of O.T.O. In 1965, shortly before his death, 
Burlingame instructed Brayton to initiate other people, which she did, expanding Solar Lodge in the 1960s to include more than 50 members.</p>
<p>By 1967, the Lodge owned several small mansions, a gas station, a bookstore, all in Los Angeles, and a desert property known as Solar Ranch in the Sonoran Desert, a North American desert which covers large 
parts of the south-western United States.</p>
<p>In 1969, the members of the lodge were charged with maltreatment of the six-year-old son of one the members in a case that came to be known as 'The Boy in the Box'.&nbsp; Brayton, her husband, and other officers fled to avoid prosecution, travelling to Mexico and Canada, and eventually engaged in a publicity campaign alleging a conspiracy against them by law enforcement officers and the courts.</p>
<p>Initially, a few members went to jail for 6 months on a felony conviction, a few went to jail for 3 months on a misdemeanour conviction, and some had their charges dismissed.&nbsp; When Brayton and
 her husband were arrested, she pleaded no contest and was sentenced to three years of probation along with a $500 fine.</p>

<p> English writer, mystic, and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley (1875 - 1947) believed he was the prophet of a new age, the <i>Æon of Horus</I>, based upon a spiritual experience he and his first wife, Rose, underwent in Cairo, Egypt in 1904.

was the investigation, study and explanation of mediumistic phenomena.</p>
<p>After moving to India, Olcott and Blavatsky began to study Eastern religions which were then included in the Society's agenda.&nbsp; Helena
 Blavatsky died in 1891, and although the Society's leaders seemed to work together amicably enough, it did not last.&nbsp; William Judge was 
accused by Olcott and Annie Besant (1847 - 1933),  author of the society, of forging letters from the Mahatmas, causing him to end his 
association with them in 1895 and take most of the Society's American section with him.</p>
<p>The faction led by Olcott and Besant is now based in India and known as the 'Theosophical Society - Adyar', while that led by Judge is known 
simply as the 'Theosophical Society', but often with the clarifying statement, 'International Headquarters, Pasadena, California'. A third organisation, the United Lodge of Theosophists or ULT, split from 
the Theosophical Society in 1909, and various small splinter groups began to form, including the Palmers Green Theosophical Lodge under the leadership of Thomas Ernst Neumark-Jones (1841 - 1912). He 
published an unsuccessful occultist journal <i>Kayfabe</i> which was largely funded by his lodge.  </p>

<p>There is and has been speculation on the presence of non-human sentient creatures on earth, interacting with humans and following some mysterious agenda for 6,000 years. 
Urbane and informed investigations by people like Richard Dolan, the formation of cults, religions and secret societies and an increasing general awareness that there are and have been

<p>The Universal Industrial Church of the New World Comforter was founded in 1967 by Allen Michael, who in 1947 was named Allen Noonan and 
claimed to have an encounter with galactic space beings that while painting a signboard he was beamed up into a mothership. </p>


<p>In 1954 he claimed to have physically encountered a flying saucer at Giant Rock in the Mojave Desert of California. During the Summer of Love, he opened the One World Family Commune with a vegan restaurant on the northeast corner of Haight and Scott streets in San Francisco, California, called the Here and Now, with 7 similar restaurants latter opening. His communal group lived in two large houses during the early 1970s in Berkeley, California. </p>

<p>In 1969, the commune established a vegan restaurant in a much larger space on Telegraph Avenue and Haste Street in Berkeley and the name of the restaurant was changed to the One World Family Natural Food Center. They published a vegetarian cookbook called Cosmic Cookery. There was a large mural on the side of the restaurant painted by Allen Michael that had written above it the phrase Farmers, Workers, Soldiers Unite — The People's Spiritual Reformation 1776–1976! The farmer was holding a pitchfork, the worker was holding a hammer, and the soldier was holding a gun, and they had their arms around each other’s shoulders. Above the three were three flying saucers coming in for a landing. 

<p>In 1973, Allen Michael founded “The Universal Industrial Church of the New World Comforter” and published the first volume of his channeled revelations, <i>The Everlasting Gospel</i>. Church headquarters and the vegetarian restaurant relocated to Stockton, California in 1975 with Allen Noonan running for President of the United States in the 1980 and 1984 elections on the Utopian Synthesis Party ticket.</p>

<p>The Universe People or Cosmic people of light powers is a Czech movement centered around Ivo
A. Benda. Its belief system is based upon the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations communicating with Benda and other
“contacters” since October 1997 telepathically, and later, by direct personal contact. </p>


<p>According to Benda, those civilizations operate
a fleet of spaceships led by Ashtar (sometimes written Ashtar Sheran) orbiting and closely watching the Earth, helping the good
and waiting to transport the followers into another dimension. The Universe People teaching incorporates various elements from
ufology (some foreign “contacters” are credited, though often also renounced after a time as misguided or deceptive), Christianity
(Jesus was a “fine-vibrations” being) and conspiracy theories (forces of evil are supposed to plan compulsory chipping of the
populace).</p>
