<div class="title">Aether/Æther/Ether <span class="sigil"><span class="large">&#128768; </span></div>
<div class="content">
<p>Chemically, aether, or ether, is a 'highly flammable pleasant-smelling colourless volatile liquid'.&nbsp; It is used as an anaesthetic and as a
 solvent or intermediate in industrial processes.</p>

<P>According to mediaeval science, aether, also called quintessence or upper air, is the  material that fills the region of the universe above the terrestrial 
sphere.&nbsp; The concept of aether continued to used in several theories to explain natural phenomena such as the medium through which light travels.</p>
Aether was at times treated as the fifth element in <a href="#alchemy">Alchemy</a>.&nbsp;  </p>
<figurel> <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/Michelsoninterferomter.png">
<img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/Michelsoninterferomter.png" title="Aether" align="left" width="100"></A></figurel>

<p>In the late 19th century, physicists postulated that aether permeated all space, providing that medium through which light could travel in the  
"vacuum" of space. However, evidence for the presence of such a medium was not found in the Michelson-Morley experiment, as no motion of either ether or earth was detected vis-a-vis the proposed movement of aether or failing that of the earth itself.</p>
<figurer><a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/Michelsoninterferomter2.png">
<img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/Michelsoninterferomter3.png" title="Aether" align="right" width="100"></A></figurer>

<P>This result of this experiment demonstrates both there there is no ether and that there is no movement of earth. The Lorentz Transformations attempted to reconcile the belief in the motion of earth with the findings of the Michelson-Morley experiment, with Einstein later taking the Lorentz Transformations as the basis of the Special Theory of Relativity. 
By the early 21st century, the failure to demonstrate the Special Theory in conjuction with the numerous Lorentz violations has helped fuel the crisis of physics.</p>

<div class="title">Salt</div>
<div class="content">
<figurer><img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/Alchemy_Salt.png" title="Alchemy - Salt" align="middle" width="100"></figurer>
<p>For <a href="Archon Philosopher Dictionary.html#alchemy">alchemists</a>, salt is allegorical for the physical body, the counterpart to <a href="#mercuryelement">mercury</a> for spirit and <a href="#sulphur">sulphur</a> for soul. In the effort to penetrate these different forces in the world through the best self-referential examplar, investigators attempted to synthesize an understanding based upon an experimental approach leaving a <a href="Archon Philosopher Dictionary.html#hermeticism">hermetic</a>, holistic, understanding. Salt is that element of substance and physicality which starts out being coarse and impure, then through alchemical processes is broken down by dissolving then purified and eventually re-formed into pure salt as a result of the interactions between mercury and sulphur.

<p>This allegorical, at time pictoral, understanding is in sharp distinction to the methodological precision and limitations of the scientific method. This method eventually separated out from philosophy proper, first known as <i>natural philosophy</i> and then as <i>modern science</i>. However, these limitations and materialism of the modern sciences has led to an unfortunate combination faith and arrogance encroaching upon modern science, coupled with incoherent theorizing in non-materialist subjects far outside of the limitations of the scientific method. This error is known as scientism.</p>

might not make much sense until you consider the fact that the element 
is a metalloid.&nbsp; Like other elements in the group, arsenic can 
transform from one physical appearance to another.&nbsp; These

acid.&nbsp; The reaction of quicksilver in nitric acid is striking as a thick red vapour hovers over the surface and bright red crystals fall to
 the bottom.&nbsp; Alchemists were convinced that mercury transcended both the solid and liquid states, both earth and heaven, life and death. The metal is often also represented by a serpent or snake.

<div class="section-card">
<div class="title">Sun <img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/sungold.png" title="Sun" align="middle" width="100"></div>
<div class="content">
<p>The astronomical and astrological symbol for the Sun is a shield with a <a href="Archon Philosopher Dictionary.html#circle">Circle</a>
 inside. Under the standard cosmological model, the Sun is an energy self-generator at the centre of a system of physical bodies, including earth, revolving around it. Due to a variety of incoherent theoretical speculations, including a magical start with the Big Bang and belief in Dark Matter as 80% of the mass of the universe, the standard model is no longer tenable.</p>

<p>The sun is by far the most important source of energy for life on <a href="#earth">Earth</a>, as recognized by many pantheons of many cultures including a sun deity as a main deity.</p>

<p>In astrology, the Sun is the ruler of <a href="#leo">Leo</a>. Paracelsus assigns the heart as the vital organ of the Sun.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of the Archon Philosopher that the silence with which Eddington's incoherent theory of the sun creating energy by means of nuclear fusion is evidence of the dread underlying contemporary scientism. Rather than announce clearly and boldly that this fusion conjecture was wrong to have been firstly accepted in the first place and then pronounced and then repeated as a "scientific finding", the "scientific community" is surreptiously hiding their lack of academic and intellectual honesty while attacking those who point this out. This bespeaks propaganda and not truth-seeking, and is a great sadness on the edifice built by Francis Bacon and so many others. </p>

<p>It is also the position of the Archon Philosopher that earth is a node within a Type III Civilization, founded by the species of the Demiurge and managed with a great number of other nodes by the Archons, who serve as Watchers, mentors, Guardians, angels. Within this node, the sun serves as the power source as well as inviting intellectual growth for humans as well as a tool for the control over behaviour in release of magnetic fields, cosmic rays, and large plasma discharges (the Deluge). In a double deception, it is in the interest of the Demiurge and Archons to actively discourage full understanding of the space of earth. Thus we see total hostility to any propogating that the Copernican Hypothesis is not correct; we also see massive support in funding and media coverage in any attempt to discover dark energy or dark matter and support of the standard model; and we witness a host of military and control structures to prevent humans from venturing to independently discover the shape of their world. </p>

<p>The Moon is an object in the sky of <a href="#earth"> Earth</a>. The physics of the moon according to its size and distance from earth is impossible in the standard cosmological model.

<P>The symbol representing the Moon is a crescent.&nbsp; In astrology, the Moon is the ruler of <a href="#cancer"> Cancer</a>. <BR>
Paracelsus assigns the brains as the vital organ of the Moon.</p>
<p>In mythology the moon is often female, a goddess who may be paired with a <a href="#sun">Sun</a>  god.&nbsp; The Greeks associated the moon with the Greek goddesses Artemis, as well as Hecate, Cynthia, and Selene.&nbsp; The Roman name for the moon is Luna.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosophyer that in the construction of our space by the leadership of the Type III Civilization, the moon likely serves a variety of purposes. The vast number of issues in explaining the features of the moon and the silence about these is startling and attempts to skirt over, or downplay, these issues is a symptom of scientism.</p>

<p>Astromomically, the path that the <a href="#sun">sun </a> makes through the background stars as seen from earth is known as the zodiac; astrologically, this path reflects
those 12 constellations of stars during the time of the ancients. The ancient Mesopotamians, Egyptians and Greeks all developed elaborate systems, with the Greeks inheriting 
ideas from the others about the divinity underlying those constellations of stars. </p>

<P>In astrology, at one's birth each of the twelve houses represents the position of the heavens at the time of a person’s birth, via which each person is assigned certain personality
traits and other characteristics reflecting the patterns of heavenly bodies at the moment of entry into worldly experience, as well as outlining a pathway forward
through events during the lifetime.</p>

<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that the stars of the heavens are a fractal image and artistic trace of the mind of the Archon responsible for constructing the node of earth within the Type III Civilization of the Demiurgic species. As such, to the extent to which that fractal image is a template for or mirror image of or coincidental pattern for other constructions on earth or within the Field of Experience, then an evaluation of such cosmic tropes as the design of this fractal may lead to gleaning some information about the path of one's possible experience. Analogy is sometimes an informing tool of logic, and sometimes the value is negligible. Sometimes one lives out the heraldry of one's ancestors. </p>
