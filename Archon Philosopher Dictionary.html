<h4>Esoteric Knowledge </h4> 

<p><BR><span class="large">&#9618; </span>&nbsp;The history of esoteric wisdom is filled with garbage as well as gems: it is sometimes hard to tell the difference. Prudence demands, however,
that we not treat any singular piece of information as wisdom, useful or definitive without supportive corroborating evidence. It is likely that no one person or culture has either generated or 
been contacted and given the "whole truth"; or if a culture or person were given or stumbled upon the core hidden knowledge, is it more than likely that they could not accurately describe it
to themselves, let alone to a distant culture, and thus it is for us today. Thus, tread gently amongst these flowers and until some formative event proves something undeniable, treat information as artistic rather than evidentiary. </p>      

<p>Esoteric knowledge is hidden (occulted) knowledge, some of it openly known and discussed as "shop talk" but in not even considered in the wider community. Thus important esoteric knowledge is discovered in many areas: 
matters of national defense, metaphysics, ontology, mathematics, the modern sciences of chemistry and physics, theoretical physics,
astrology, astronomy (those parts outside use of the modern scientific method), alchemy, mythology and other stories of interactions with non-human sentient creatures,
geomancy and other hidden serendipitous and synchronistic connections, angelology/dæmonology/demonology, organizations dedicated to un-covering or keeping secret esoteric information (including official government
agencies), ceremonial magic (and other psychological studies),  occulted knowledge in secret books in secured libraries, religion, mysticism, and some small other areas adjacent to the "music of the mystery". <BR><BR><BR></p>

<p>The Advanced Aeronautic Threat Identification Program of the USA Pentagon released, in December 2017, confirmation of video tape and testimony of both
pilots and Aegis Radar personnel on a 2004 incident known as the Tic Tac Incident and of a 2015 incident known as the Gimbal Incident. 
In 2004, a space craft (the candy Tic Tac looking) manuoevered at 400g (gravities), roughly 60,000 miles per hours, exceeding current human
technological ability of 14 g, and demonstrated clear consciousness by intercepting and translating messages of locations, and then 
preceding the human pilots to those locations.  The 2004 Tic Tac event happened off the West Coast of America. A similar situation happened in the 
2015 Gimbal Incident.

<p>These incidents were further confirmed by the Pentagon in press releases in September 2019.</p>

<p>These incidents follow on a host of whistleblower, non-military professional, and other credible reports of non-human consciousness involvement in human affairs dating
back to human pre-flight days, all the way back for 6,000 years to the beginning of writing. These incidents reflect only a small part of the 6,000 year-long experiental topology of UFO/UAP events: <a href="./finalpapers/CompleteUFOTheories.pdf">Complete UFO/UAP Theories</a>.</p></div>

    Abrahamic Revealation</div>
  <div class="content">
    <P>Abraham was the singular and immensely successful founder of a metaphysical system that pointed to a singuar God as creator of everything. It is the position of the <em>Archon Philosopher</em> that this was the moment in history of the <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/FirstNexus.png">First Nexus</a>, where the (<a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/3PlanAPlanB2022.png"><em>Plan B</em></a>) of monothesism was promoted to replace the polytheistic <em>Plan A</em> of the involvement of the polytheistic mentoring: <a href="#archons">Archons =  Visible Angels = Aliens</a>. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are currently the three major divisions of the Abrahamic Revealation, the most successful of the three contemporary attempts at monotheism in the Wider Western Civilization.</p> 
<figurela><a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/3PlanAPlanB2022.png"><img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/3PlanAPlanB2022.png" title="Timeline of History" align="left" width="100"></a></figurela>
<P>As with the failed attempts by <a href="#akhenaten">Akhenaten</a>'s and <a href="#zoroaster">Zoroaster</a> at installing the <em>Plan B</em> metaphysics, the likely objectives of establishing a monothesistic metaphysics were to 
ensure humans remain on a path to 1) provide resources for the Demiurge and 2) keep awareness of the powers, situation, and location of humans hidden. This switch of metaphysical approach within the Wider Western Civilization has
resulted in varying degrees of silencing of different metaphysical approaches, thus removing distractions and focusing human drives in more "productive" avenues.</p>
<p>The Apocraphal text <i>The Testament of Abraham</i>, known also as the <i>Revelation of Abraham</i>, details a conversation with God (perhaps <a href="#demiurge"><em>Demiurge</em></a> as the head of the Archons) as the reason for choosing Abraham in Chapter XX:</p>
<blockquote>
AND THE ETERNAL MIGHTY ONE SAID TO ME: “Abraham, Abraham!” And I said: “Here am I.” And He said: “Consider from above the stars which are beneath thee, and number them for me, and make known to me their number.” And I said: “When can I? For I am but a man of dust and ashes. And he said to me: “As the number of the stars and their power, so will I make thy seed a nation and a people, set apart for me in my heritage with Azazel.” </blockquote>

  <div class="title">Abraxas / Abrasax <img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/abraxas2c.png" title="Abraxas" align="middle" width="100"></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>Abraxas, a variant of 'Abrasax', is the <a href="#gnosticism">Gnostic</a> deity, variously analogized with Hebrew Yahweh, <a href="MysteriesoftheTwiceBorn.html#mithras">Mithras</a> (the Phyrigian-Persian god in the Roman Empire mysteries
between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>nd</sup> centuries CE), Yeshu (Jesus) and others and itself alone. This entity held primary mystic meaning in the system of Basilides<sup>1</sup>.
<p>The word 'Abraxas' is found in many <a href="#gnosticism"> Gnostic</a> texts, such as the <i>Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit</i> (the <i>Coptic Gospel of the Egyptians</i>). 
The name also appears in the <i>Greek Magical Papyri</i> (the body of papyri from Graeco-Roman Egypt containing magical spells).</p>
<p>The <a href="#chnoubis">Chnoubic</a> symbol of Abraxas was engraved on gemstones (known as 'Abraxas stones'), which were used as <a href="#amulets">amulets</a> from at least the 2<sup>nd</sup>
century, and which were used as recently as the 13th century in the seals of the <a href="#knightstemplar">Knights Templar</a>.</p>
<p>Carl Jung (1875 - 1961) transcribed a short Gnostic treatise in 1916, attributed to Basilides, called <i>The Seven Sermons to the Dead</i>, which called Abraxas the 
supreme power of being, transcending both God and the Devil, and as the unity of all opposites as into one Being.</p>


<p>The seven letters comprising the name 'Abraxas' may represent each of the seven classic planets. Similarly, the word could be related to
 'abracadabra', although other etymologies exist. See also <a href="#iao">IAO</a>.
</p><p>
<i><sup>1</sup> Basilides was an early Gnostic in Alexandria, Egypt, from 117 to 138 CE.</i></p>

  <div class="title">Adam Kadmon <img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/adamkadmon.png" title="Adam Kadmon" align="bottom" width="80"></div>
  <div class="content">
<p>According to Lurianic <a href="#kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>, before creation began, all that existed was 'God's' Infinite Light. The first stage of creation began when 'God' 
(Ain-Soph) contracted Its infinite light to create a vacuum. Then a "Ray of Divine Light" penetrated that vacuum and the persona of Adam Kadmon was projected into it.
<p>Adam Kadmon, the heavenly man - or in Platonic terms the essence or perfect form of man, revealed itself in the four worlds: 1. Atziluth (Archetype) 2. Beri'ah (Creative) 3. Yetzirah (Formative) 4. Assiah (Physical).  The ten concentric circles of the Sephiroth were vessels to receive the ray but were shattered from the force of the emanation of light. </p> 
<P> It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that the shattering of the Sephiroth was the manifestation of the <a href="#lawofunintendedconsequences">Law of Unintended 
Consequences</a> that appears within the interplay of events and forces and actors within our world. This Law of Unintended Consequences drives the unexpectedness of outcome into both what allows for free will and what draws events together into (formerly) hidden patterns. A semantic generating function of this is <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/LawsofPhysicalNatureSephiroticTree.png">here</a>.

<p>Thus when the <a href="#demiurge">Demiurge </a>was in the <i><a href="#delayedchoicequantumeraserexperiment">overhang of pre-time</a></i> (Pleroma/contraction of Ain-Soph), its artistic/holistic impression served as the telelogical cause for which the <a href="keyideas.html#heidegger">equiprimordial</a> <em>Laws of Physical Nature</em> (ray of divine light/ the later Sephiroth) organized themselves so as to allow that impression to become real in the collapse of the universal wave-function, and becoming real with both ontological creativity and stability with destruction and chaos as features within the material lived-in-world.</p>

<p>The Adar is the sacred <a href="#fire">Fire</a> of the <a href="#zoroaster">Zoroastrians</a> symbolising purity, the essence of life, and the presence of God.&nbsp;
 In the Zoroastrian creation story, fire is the final creation bringing life to all things that preceded it.&nbsp; It is a similar concept to 
the Ruach ha Elohim (divine spirit/animating force of life).&nbsp; The sacred flame is presided over by Asha Vahista (Holiest Truth), one of the Amesha Spentas
 or 'bounteous immortals', divine beings similar to Archangels.&nbsp; The fire is fed with offerings of sandalwood from worshippers.  </p>

<p>The sacred fire is kept burning continuously in Zoroastrian temples; Zoroastrians must pray only in the presence of a fire.&nbsp; The Adar is
 the origin of the idea of an 'eternal flame'.&nbsp; The sacred flame in  the temple at Yazd Iran/Persia has reputedly burned continuously for fifteen hundred years. </p>

<p>Chemically, aether, or ether, is a 'highly flammable pleasant-smelling colourless volatile liquid'.&nbsp; It is used as an anaesthetic and as a

<p>In the late 19th century, physicists postulated that aether permeated all space, providing that medium through which light could travel in the  
"vacuum" of space. However, evidence for the presence of such a medium was not found in the Michelson-Morley experiment, as no motion of either ether or earth was detected vis-a-vis the proposed movement of aether or failing that of the earth itself.</p>

<P>This result of this experiment demonstrates both there there is no ether and that there is no movement of earth. The Lorentz Transformations attempted to reconcile the belief in the motion of earth with the findings of the Michelson-Morley experiment, with Einstein later taking the Lorentz Transformations as the basis of the Special Theory of Relativity. 
By the early 21st century, the failure to demonstrate the Special Theory in conjuction with the numerous Lorentz violations has helped fuel the crisis of physics.</p>

<p>Alchemy refers to both the early scientific approach to the natural science of physics and chemistry, and to an allegorical expression of human experience with matter. Most notably, the elements salt (matter), sulfur (soul) and mercury (spirit) are discussed in terms of the nascent mind-body problem (salt and sulfur) as well as (sulfur) the translation from genotype to phenotype problem - how is life infused with the energy of life.

<div class="content">
<P>There are differences between amulets and talismans. Amulets are magical objects of healing and protection against
harm, disease, and misfortune, which often invoke the help of God or gods, angels, daimons, demons, or other supernatural powers. </p>

<p>Talimans are objects, drawings, inscriptions, or symbols endowed with supernatural or magical power, which confer their
power upon their possessors. Talismans attract good luck, success, fortune, health, fecundity, virility, love, and power. Talismans also
confer protective power. They are inscribed with the names of celestial entities, which the magician uses to command (fallen) angelic forces.</p>

<p>Through consecration of a talisman or amulet by invoking words, amulets and talismans gain force; the same can be said of events, where propaganda and misinformation/disinformation lend force to that event, as the description of the event takes on a "life all on its own" regardless of the actual unfolding of events. <i>"History is written by the victors"</i> is the creation of an <em>event amulet</em> or <em>event talisman</em>.</p>

<p>Relics are objects that had been physically attached to a human or object of some great significance. Thus, in the philosophy of the Archon Philosopher, it is suspected that there is a specific or greater infusion of some metaphysical entity within that relic. Large relics are housed in reliquaries also known as shrines; portable holders of relics are called fereter, 
and a chapel in which it is housed a feretory.</p>

<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that all of the forces of the universe derive from the ontological basis of the interplay of the equiprimordial <a href="#lawsofphysicalnature">Laws of Physical Nature</a>, and that
one of these Laws is consciousness. As a result of the interplay of the Laws of Physical Nature in forming the liveable world, metaphysical entities are created, such as the Fibonacci Series,
the Feigenbaum Constant and others, and that human interaction within this field of experience relies on both the given forces and upon <a href="./finalpapers/anewdefinitionoftruth.pdf">Truth</a>, and thus artistically or holistically gleaning 
patterns from this interplay is possible but haphazard, in that the interplay underlying the patterns shift and morph as in a dynamic spiral, making any consistent meaning-laden amulaic or talismanic force
impossible. Temporary insight and focus, as well as just lucky connections, are the best results that amulets or talismans can provide; though consideration of the risks that amulets and talismans guard against is in itself 
a meaning-laden protective and power-generating exercise. </p>

<p>As an analogy, one may picture a sportsman who has a lucky-charm and this may affect his play within the game, but cannot affect the size of the field, the gravity affecting the ball, or such givens. However, the metaphysical entities
that appear in the game such as the patterns of other players actions, the statistical flow of the game, and the (dis) advantages of risk, would be discernable and manipulatable by a player "in the zone". The amulet or talisman may adjust
a player's confidence and thus stance vis-á-vis other players, also then necessarily affecting those players' confidence and stances. One may thus "psyche out" other players, but not the physics of the game itself.</p>

<div class="section-card"><div class="title">Archons</div>
<div class="content">
<P><em>Archon</em> means "rulers". In the Gnostic tradition, the entities are variously described from evil to good, but are generally seen as the facilitators of the wishes of the <em>Demiurge</em>. The <em>Demiurge</em> was detailed by Plato in the <i>Timaeus</i> as the creator of the physical world.</p> 
<figurel><img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/3PlanAPlanB2022.png" title="Timeline of History" align="left" width="100"></figurel>
<P>It is the position of the <em>Archon Philosopher</em> that <em>Archons</em> are non-human sentient creatures who have interpenetrated earth and are deeply involved in human affairs, and have been since the very inception of humans. Different groups have used different names for the non-human sentient beings who likely are comprised of many different species, and are described with having widely differing features. Thus, without having the ability to consistently identify and attach features to different species of <em>Archons</em>, the overarching identifier of <em>Archon</em> has been chosen. In the literature of the distant past from ancient Egypt, ancient Mesopotamia, ancient Persia, and ancient Greece the consistency of descriptions and power of these sentient entities, including hybrid human-<am>Archon</em> offspring, include the English names:</p>
<ul>
<li>angels/fallen angels/demons</li> 
<li>aliens</li> 
<li>gods</li> 
<li>Guardians</li> 
<li>Watchers/Sentinels</li> 
<li>Nephilim/Anakim/giants</li> 
<li>Giants</li> 
<li>Rephaim</li>
<li>incubus/succubus</li> 
<li>daemons/dæmons/daimons</li> 
<li>Angel of the Lord</li>
<li>egregores/grigori</li>
<li>Ancient of Days</li> 
<li>Kings of Earth (Psalm 2/Revelation 1:5-6)</li>
<li>Saints of the Lord</li> 
<li>uthra</li>
<li>Tzevaot/Tsebaoth/Sabaoth (armies of angels)</i>
<li>serpents</li>
<li>Lords of the Sword</li> </ul>

<p>To appreciate <em>Archon</em>'s role, all aspects of their historical relations to humans should be considered namely:</p> 
<ul>
<li>they have not killed us despite having easy resources to do so</li>
<li>they are technologically extremely advanced and have been for all of human history</li>
<li>there is a consistent 6,000 year <em>experiential topology</em> of their presence and technology up until today</li>
<li>we cannot arrogantly presume to have knowledge of their moral stances given their actions</li>
<li>we should not be afraid of them as they have not killed us or kept us in torture</li>
<li>we have been permitted to live basically freely in a wondrous place (earth)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is speculation of the Archon Philosopher that the <em>Archons</em> are genetically engineered decendants of the Demiurge, as are humans, and that we all inhabit one universe which is comprised of a Type III Civilization. <em>Archons</em> have "graduated" to become overseers of the various nodes of the Type III Civilization and that the investment in time and resources into earth requires a massive output by humans. The best analogy is one of humans being farmed to <a href="#abraham">"number the stars"</a> and collapse a wave-function of those stars once understood (numbered). Whatever the resources are that human provide or will provide into the Type III Civilization, this output of resources must warrant the investment into humans. Humans are <em>Archons</em> in waiting. </p>

<p>Astrology is the <a href="./finalpapers/Outline_of_All_Science.pdf">science</a> of elucidating the effect of the heavens, planets and stars, on to individual and collective human affairs. 
The positions of the heavenly bodies vis-a-vis each other at a given moment in time and over spans of time indicate shifting influences. The planetary bodies have been aligned with both forces and with divine personalities.
Astrology should be clearly distinguished from the observational science of <a href="./finalpapers/Outline_of_All_Science.pdf">astronomy</a>, which with the related science of astrophysics as over-reached its boundaries falling into the mire of scientism.</p>

<p>The Archon Philosopher views the lights in the sky as lights on the surface of a dome. They represent preferred vantage points for the various Watchers/Archons/aliens to monitor and 
establish common flight paths to launch their expeditions to oversee or interact with humans, or to fulfill other assigned tasks within the Type III Civilization. 
Thus, it seems as while there may be a connection between human activity and the lights in the sky, it is unclear what that connection is or what effect it may have. However, to the 
extent that any "planet" or "star" may refer to an ally of the Demiruge, there may be a history of interaction contained with any identified written traces. </p>

History thus corroborates the teaching of the conception that only in the maturity of reality does the ideal appear as counterpart to the real, 
apprehends the real world in its substance, and shapes it into an intellectual kingdom. When philosophy paints its grey in grey, one 
form of life has become old, and by means of grey it cannot be rejuvenated, but only known. The owl of Minerva takes its flight only

The primordial hill symbol seen in Egyptian inscriptions is one of the oldest of symbols reflecting the pyramidion capstone to either pyramids or <a href="  ">obelisks</a>.

The inset image refers back to the Twelft dynasty with other representars dating to the Fifth Dynasty.</p>

<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that the benben, as obelisk, is the symbol of Ptah, the Demiurge. It is across this horizon of the benben that the Ptah fabricated the world.

<div class="title">Book of Ages <img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/bookofages.png" title="Book of Ages" align="middle" width="100"></div>
<div class="content">
<P>The Book of Ages is a metaphysical treatise written by Andrew Twohig detailing a multi-consciousness ontology and perhaps the first ever non-magical metaphysics. 
Based upon the repeated findings of the <a href="#delayedchoicequantumeraserexperiment">Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment</a> and the Double Slit Experiment, the Book of Ages details a starkly different universe, created and
directed by a Demiurgic species which has over time created a Type III Civilization. Earth is but one node of many within this expanding but compact universe. </p>

<p> Central in this post-Heideggerian analysis is the "clearing"/field of experience, which is formed with the necessary collapse of a universal wave-function from the "overhang of pre-time", a
possible ontological location visible in the <a href="#delayedchoicequantumeraserexperiment">Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment</a>. The equiprimordial Laws of Physical Nature surround/interpentrate this <a href="keyideas.html#heidegger">clearing</a> to allow for experience, while 
themselves not accessible within the world. As such, as human consciousness attempts to understand each Law, the further along this pathway, the stranger the findings become, leading to the notion of 
<a href="keyideas.html#bakhutin">unfinalizability</a>. The Book of Ages also touches upon history as a Experiential Topology as regards the 6,000 year Demiurgic and Archonic <a href="#archons">Archons = Visible Angels = Aliens</a> interventions 
into human affairs, as recently admitted to in the Tic Tac and Gimbal Incidents, but as repeatedly witnessed by perhaps 10's of millions of people living today, most notably in the Black Triangle events in Belguim,
Arizona, and New York state.</p>

<p>Within the analysis is a recognition of a <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/triplecreationdoubledeception.png">double deception</a> that 1) humans are structurally misled about the lights in the sky in a necessary effort to allow full 
belief in the lights as real in order to allow human collapse of a wave-function of that belief, and 2) that humans are not a "junior Archon" with immense formative powers of the collapse of wave-functions in an effort to maintain human false beliefs.   Despite this <em>double deception</em>, it is likely that all Archons went along a similar path of providing resources and then becoming aware of their natures and arising across spans of time into a more full participation in the Type III Civilization and management of the multitude of existing and emerging nodes.</p>

the Sphynx, the Etruscan Chimera of Arezzo, Pegasus, Simurgh, Griffins, Ziz, Manticore, Lamassu, Centaur, Satyrs, Harpy, Medusa, <a href="#abraxas">Abraxas/Chnoubis</a>,

<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that mention of these creatures and the giants (children of Nephilim and sons of man) are both an indication of the nature of life

<div class="title">Cognitive Jump <imgsrc="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/dysonsphere.png" title="Dyson Sphere" align="middle" width="100"></div>
<div class="content">
<p>The <i>cognitive jump</i> is a proposed explanation of why people cannot fathom the reality of Unidentified Aerial 
Phenomenon/UAP or extraterrestrial Unidentified Flying Objects/UFOs, or other non-human consciousness involvement in
our world. As detailed by J. Allen Hynek:</p>
<blockquote>Suppose our present understanding of the world about us is thought of as one of the rungs of a ladder, 
sort of a “ladder of knowledge.” When something new comes along which is just a step or two above this rung, it is not 
difficult for us to make the small transition upward. But, let something come along which is many, many rungs above our 
present level of understanding, then the human mind rebels at the transition; the jump to the higher rung is just too great."</blockquote>

<p>The issue of a cognitive jump is underpinned by the permanent state of <i>information asymmetry</i>, in which there is information which others know and
which one does not know. At times of convergence of events, sudden realization of the <em>danger to sustainability</em> impels one to quickly
readjust to the <i>information asymmetry</i>. This rapid readjustment may express itself in concrete actions such as "panic buying". As information is the only <em>reactive structural feature of
consciousness within the world</em>, changing information may have the ability to change the design and expression of the world, for both human and non-human sentient creatures, while requiring that
the Laws of Physical Nature be adhered to. </p> 

<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that collectively there has been a balking at the need to overturn the Copernican 
System, a refusal to dispense with the dark matter/dark energy magical "standard model" of astrophysics. That modern physics has been imbued with magical thinking is a profound disservice. </p>

<p>A deep reluctance to accept the re-emergence of difficult metaphysical-ontological-epistemological questions, indicates that a threshold must be reached before the required cognitive jump is effected. Certainly, superficial personal issues are involved as uncertainty of those who have staked careers on defending the pre-overturned paradigm are at risk. In addition, there may be some blockage from interference of non-human consciousnesses and/or their human agents or humans merely acting as agents, as such re-thinkings by humans may have wide effect.</p>
<p>Regardless, the crisis in physics since the Michelson-Morley experiment and the litany of unfounded scientism pronouncements
placed metaphysics into a cocoon of silence. Undeniable facts on the ground are changing this, forcing everyone to take
that next step on the ladder, though it be many rungs distant.</p>

<div class="title">Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment</div>
<div class="content">
<p>The Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment of 1999 changed all of philosophy, and thus all of our possible understanding of this universe. </p>

<p>Briefly, in this experiment, a photon of light is split with a prism and one entangled part immediately is recorded upon a surface. The other entangled part passess though a series of mirros to delay its arrival at a randomized Double Slit process, where it then hits a surface in either a wave-interference pattern or a two-bar pattern. In every case, the first landing agrees with the second as to whether it is (was?) a wave-interference or two-bar pattern. Thus, there is information about a future universe for which a choice will not have had been made. [Note the bizarre verb tense used to describe this. Other verb choices are likely also possible.] In short, there is a structural feature of this universe of a pre-echo of future events.</p>

<p>In this experiment, humans are able to an ever so small glimpse of a future for which a choice has not yet been made.  Further, we may view this experiment to glimpse a structural
feature of the universe that we do not normally see. In so doing, we may take this experiment to serve as some time of scope, like a telescope or a microscope, which lets us see not really <b>the</b> future, but rather <b>a</b> future, allowing humans and some other sentient creatures to have information about the/a future before that future happens, or could in the interim be changed into a different future, by a member of the Demiurgic species, which is proposed as that sentient creature which naturally and easily can see that structural feature. </p>

<p>However, the future that is visible in this experiment is not the importance of this experiment; rather, this experiment points to the possibiliy of another sentient creature with cognitive abilities that allow it to collapse a wave-function from this position that the experiment has located (a member of the Demiurgic species). This location is anywhere and anytime in the universe, as it is a structural feature of the universe. Any sentient creature with the ability to "see" this location and have the ability to collapse wave-functions in specific ways, would then be able to, in principle, restructure parts of the universe. These parts would be limited to those parts for which that sentient creature has information about. </p>

<p>As an anology, a color sighted person can see, say, a red door in a green wall, where a color-blind person cannot. Equally, a color sighted person is not always aware of the specific color of some object, but may focus the mind and thereby be able to explicitly see and say that color. </p>

<p>It is likely that the correct categories of thought (as per Kant) would allow the Demiruge to see that location easily and at will, to gain an insight into some future event, and as this is information about an event that is not (yet or ever) real and thus not be subject to the constraints shown in the Double Slit experiment, to collapse a universal wave-function in either that way or some different way. </p>

<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that a member of the Demiurgic species was able in the originary collapse of the universal wave-function, to collapse this universe into being and then find itself nestled nicely in the middle of this <a href="#fieldofexperience"><em>Field of Experience</em></a>, in the middle of our shared lived-in world, in the middle of our shared universe, as safely and sustainably positioned within the middle of what Heidegger refers to as <a href="keyideas.html#heidegger"><em>the clearing</em></a>.</p> 

<p>It is deeply historically interesting that his ability to create a universe by means of words is listed not only later on in Abrahamic documents, but previously by <a href="#ptah">Ptah in Egypt, <a href="#nammu">Nammu</a> in Mesopotamia, <a href="#zurvan">Zurvan</a> in Persia and <a href="#Phanes">Phanes</a> by the Orphic Greek tradition.

<div class="section-card">
<div class="title">Deluge</div>
<div class="content">
<p>'Deluge' means the great pouring, normally thought of as rain, but not all stories handed down refer to rain. 
A common feature among the Epic of Gilgamesh, the flood story of Noah, and the flood story of Deucalion Myth from Greece is that 
a warning came from a non-human consciousness to a human in order to save animals and some humans from the Deluge. For the Greeks it was Deucalion, son of Titan <a href="#prometheus">Prometheus</A>; for the Mesopotamians it was the god Ea (Enki) to Uta-Napishtim, the later-made-immortal ancestor of Gilgamesh; and for the Abrahamic tradition it was God who gave the warning and instruction, as recounted in the Torah. In the Book of Enoch, it was the <a href="#angels">Archangel</a> Uriel who gave the warning to Noah. </p>

<p>The term Ante-Deluvian means after the deluge, and is a critical turning point in assessing the stories handed down; see
<a href="./finalpapers/TellingsandRetellings.pdf">Plan A and Plan B</a> and see <a href="Deluge/Deluge Introduction.html">List of 19 Ancient Accounts 
 of the Deluge</a>. This reflects a shift from 1<sup>st</sup> Generation gods (the Titans in the Greek naming system) who were active in mentoring to the distant 2<sup>nd</sup> Generation gods, the (the Olympians in the Greek anaming system). The main shift at this the <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/FirstNexus.png">First Nexus</a> was from a polythesism to a monotheism. For ease of calculation, the dating of the deluge may be placed at 2,000-3000 BCE, that is, after Enoch, during Noah, and slighly before Abraham, Zoroaster, and Akhenaten.

<P>The deluge may be water, or water personified, some other substance for which the best descriptive word at that 
time was a watery flood. The Abrahamic, Greek and Mesopotamian stories refer to bad deeds of humans as causing the deluge, from the Epic of Gilgamesh: "The hearts of the people of Shurippak induced the great gods to make a windstorm". The <i>Book of Enoch</i> indicates clear involvement of the Nephilim/Anakim as giants from Archons/Visible Angels (fallen)/aliens and human women -a hybridization; thus, there may be a motivation
of a cleansing of <a href="#archons">Archons = Visible Angels = Aliens</a>, that is non-human sentient creatures, from further interference in human affairs. </p>

<p> It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that the deluge was most likely not only of water on the coasts but also of an electric plasma storm (re. Carrington Event)
that was specifically aimed by the Demiurge at removing the Archonic mentors at the time (the Titans) in order to 
enact a reset. The giants and their Archon/Titan/alien parents most likely returned to their own nodes or were destroyed, while apparently some Archons 
survived and wished to stay on earth: Mede, Thoth/Orpheus/Hermes/Cadmus, Og, Aeneas, Nimrod, Seth, Melchizedek, and the first Tage of the Etruscan civilization another likely candidate.</p>

<div class="section-card">
<div class="title">Demiurge <imgsrc="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/circle.gif" title="Circle" align="middle" width="100"></div>
<div class="content"> 	 
<p>The Demiurge is the creator, "artisan", of the physical world, first recorded in Plato's last completed work <i>Timaeus</i>.The <em>Demiurge</em> is the center-point the Gnostic tradition, as seen in the Nag Hammadi texts as well as featuring within Neoplatonic texts. </p>

<p>Within these descriptions, we see startling parallels with descriptions of the lead "gods" of the ancient Egyptian, Persian and Mesopotamian polytheistic systems. Using a hermeneutic approach, we may easily and convincingly glean that these descriptions follow the same general course, and thus are likely describing the same series of events; the events namely of the creation of the <em>Demiurge</em>, creation of the world/universe, and creation of the various non-human sentient creatures (<em>Archons</em>) that regularly interact with humans. Various names were accorded to the <em>Demiurge</em> in the very distant, antediluvian, past:</p>  

<ul>
<li>of Egypt: <a href="#ptah">Ptah</a></li>
<li>of Mesopotamia: <a href="#nammu">Nammu</a></li>
<li>of Persia: <a href="#zurvan">Zurvan</a></li></ul>

<p>These names changed after the deluge, post-diluvian, and became more distant and more infused with speculative traits rather than experiential first-hand data. Today, the first-hand experience is re-surfacing via the internet and better communications of the "alien" craft that ply earth's skies. This forgetting of the distant past and the <em>Demiurgic</em> and <em>Archon</em> involvement was an intentiona part of the switch from <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/3PlanAPlanB2022.png"><em>Plan A</em></a> to <em>Plan B</em></p>

<p>In Mandaeism, the Hayyi Rabbi and Yushamin pair reflect, perhaps, the Demiurge within the Pleroma (overhang of pre-time in the 1999 Experiment) and the Demiurge as it found itself manifested tangibly within the world with others.
In any case, there may be some naming issues where one name refers to an entity pre-wave-function collapse of the universe and another name to that entity post-wave-function collapse.</p>


<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that the Demiurge is that species which boot-strapped itself into existence, via the 
<em>overhang of pre-time</em> identified within the <a href="#delayedchoicequantumeraserexperiment">Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment</a>. Following its own collapse of a universal wave function, the Demiurge sought resources
to expand the simple and small universe it managed to collapse into. Creation of other life forms, known and described variously as <a href="#archons">Archons = Visible Angels = Aliens</a> was undertaken in a likely effort to battle against scarcity, to push back against entroy, in a battle that all life forms must do.</p>

<P>We have some evidence, which is not from findings of modern scientific experiments, of the Demiurge and its allies with the releases of the <a href="#aatip">AATIP program</a>, 
in testimonies of thousands of people who say they had encounters with non-human consciousnesses or witnessed their craft, with the underlying motivations for creations of 
geoglyphs and other structures, and in ancient texts which struggle to detail events that contemporary humans would struggle far less in describing; notably Enoch, Ezra, Ezeikel. </p>

<p>A metaphysical-ontological-epistemological explanation of a boot-strapping entity such as the Demiurge is now possible given
the Double Slit and Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiments, modern science's arrival at the irreducible laws of physics, and
Heidegger's exposition of the "clearing", what is otherwise described as <a href="#fieldofexperience"><em>Field of Experience</em></a>. 
Given this approach of what is and what has to be, the Demiurge as a force to be reckoned with is fully within our midst. </p>

<p>There remains many questions, one of them regarding the definition of omnipotence (all powerful) and omniscience (all knowing). There are two interpretations of what these terms could mean: 1) experiential, and 2) logical/intellectual. As a child regards their parents for some amount of time as all powerful and all knowing, we may refer to assessment of this power and information asymmetry as the experiential interpretation. Logically or intellectually we can create thought experiments that expand from experience into the realm of possibility. We may rightly inquires as to which assessment was meant when applied to: 1) the God of Abraham, 2) the God of Zoroaster, 
or 3) the God of Akhenaten. The Demiurge, as a member of a sentient technologically advanced species, is certainly all powerful and all knowing in an experiential sense, but not in a logical/intellectual sense.</p>

<p>The Archon Philosopher views this with:  "Ptah was often referred to as <i>the noble djed</i>, and carried a scepter that was a combination of the djed symbol and the ankh, the symbol of life."<BR><BR>

<div class="title">Double Slit Experiment</div>
<div class="content">
<p>The Double Slit experiment was first performed by Thomas Young in 1801, with candlelight moving through two slits then forming a wave interference pattern. However, experiments in the 1920s by  Davisson and Germer and also Thomson and Reid began to uncover major issues when applied to atoms and molecules. Niels Bohr and John Van Neumann were among the first to recognize the role of consciousness in the ontological descriptions needed to explain the findings of the Double Slit Experiment.</p>

<p>The extreme and obscure nature of the relationship between consciousness and matter is evidenced by firing singular particles comprising over 1500 atoms, with detectors afterwards both 1) detecting which slit any particle goes through and 2) making information available of which slit that was. From this experimentation, it is clear that consciousness collapses a wave-function, which is a quantum-mechanical characterization of an isolated physical system, into an existing particle. </p>

<p>We may note that according to Niels Bohr and the Copenhagen interpretation generally, that once a probablistic wave-function is collapsed for one sentient creature upon gaining information about which way the particle went, that result remains a fixed result for all other sentient creatures.</p>

<p>We may also note that in the Many Worlds Interpretation, that all choices including to detect and gain information or not, are probablistic outcomes, suggesting that the whole universe is a wave-function that is collapsed into reality. However, given the previous note, it should be understood that in the interests of stability and sustainability of our <a href="#fieldofexperience"><em>Field of Experience</em></a>, any single sentient creature may not re-collapse or alternatively collapse something already collapsed by another sentient creature.</p>

<p>Ultimately, moving from wave functions to reality, within the metaphysical structure of the <a href="#lawsofphysicalnature">Laws of Physical Nature</a>, is a movement out of superposition - an indefinited (undefined) state - into a defined state. This is made possible by the interaction of consciousness via an individuated sentient creature (or many) and the pre-existing lived-in world. The originary collapse of the universal wave-function occured via that sentient creature who can access <em>Time A</em> in the <a href="#delayedchoicequantumeraserexperiment">1999 Delayed Choice Experiment</a>.</p>


<figurela><a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/ptah.jpg"><img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/ptah.jpg" title="Ptah Double Slit" align="middle" width="100"></a></figurela>
<P>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that the necessary involvement of consciousness in the experiment secures Consciousness its place among the 
Laws of Physical Nature, the laws that are required in order that we have a <em>Field of Experience</em>. The current crisis of modern physics primarily results from the deeply unfortunate inclusion of astrophysics as on an epistemological par with modern physics. Coupled with materialist and foundationalist assumptions, investigations into the non-material Laws of Physical Nature (Time, Consciousness, Causality, Connectedness - all of which are both experienced and measurable but not subject to physical experimentation), philosophy was temporarily paused and lead slightly off track with the great findings of modern physics. Metaphysical and ontological investigations, in line with acceptance of formerly no-go areas such as investigations of non-human sentient creatures, have opened up avenues to announce a non-magical metaphysics and multi-consciousness ontology.</p>


<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that the "artisan of the physical world" in Plato's terminology, the <a href="#demiurge">Demiurge</a>, (historically named <a href="#ptah">Ptah</a>, <a href="#nammu">Nammu</a>, <a href="#zurvan">Zurvan</a>, and <a href="#phanes">Phanes</a>) is that type of sentient creature which is able to collapse an originary universal wave-function from the overhang of pre-time (<em>Time A</em>), a location evidenced in the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment.</p>

<P>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that earth is within a Dyson-like Sphere within a Type III Civilization within a <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/compactuniverse.png">Compact Universe</a>, with the fixed stars being lights on the inner surface of the Dyson-like Sphere. A massive cognitive jump is today required to both understand this vastly different universe as humans are under a <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/triplecreationdoubledeception.png">double deception</a> and to integrate the information about Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon/Unidentified Flying Objects/non-human consciousness. It is clear that there are vested interests who wish to control modern science by destroying it, if necessary. The Copernican Hypothesis has not yet been confirmed and has repeatedly been proven against, yet the destruction of modern science by elevating theory over modern scientific findings is a descent into into a faith-based scientism of dark matter, dark energy, or big bang magic. A return to the epistemologically sound basis of findings of modern scientific experiments is needed to return humans to a secure path of discovery. </p>

<div class="content">
<p>Earth is one of the four classical elements in ancient Greek philosophy and alchemiac science.&nbsp; In <a href="#alchemy">Alchemy</a>, Earth was believed to be primarily dry, and secondarily cold, as per 
Aristotle, with <a href="#salt">Salt</a> as the related chemical substance, as salt is the metaphor for physical in humans. The alchemical symbol, <span class="sigil3">&#128771;</span>, is a downward-pointing triangle, bisected by a horizontal line .</p>
<p>In astrology, Earth relates to the astrological signs <a href="#capricorn">Capricorn</a>, <a href="#taurus">Taurus</a> and <a href="#virgo">Virgo</a>.

<p>In anceint Greece, Earth as a planetary symbol is depicted as a globe bisected by a meridian line, and was associated with the sensual aspects of both life and death.</p>

<p>Ancient Greek goddess (Mother Earth) <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/3gensGreek.png">Gaia</a>, 
Egyptian god <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/3gensEgypt.png">Geb</a>, 
Mesopotamian <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/3gensMesopotamia.png">Ki</a>, and 
Persian <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/3gensPersian.png">Ahura Mazda</a> created earth.</p>
<p>Kabbalists place earth as the physical manifestation on the tree of life at the bottom in Malkuth. The archangel of Earth is Uriel, the angel is Phorlakh, the ruler is Kerub, the king is Ghob, and the Earth elementals are called Gnomes.</p>
<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that planet earth is a node within a Type III Civilization, created by the Demiurge in order to generate vast amounts of resources
by harvesting the unique human ability to collapse wave-functions. This process has taken substantial time and the size of the investment may been gleaned from the amount
of attention by UAP/UFO and interactions that have taken place across a 6,000 Experiential Topology. The creation of the earth is not coincident with the creation of the universe, but
is a later creation, in the model of the <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/triplecreation.png">Triple Creation</a>.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>There were 13 elements known to the ancients. More were known to the Islamic scientists and more again by the Medieval European alchemists, adding to that collection of knowledge once documents 
from the Bagdhad, Damascus, Samarkand and Toledo began to filter across Europe in the 1100s. Aristotelian science was gradually being replaced by an introduction of experimentation and finally 
with the writings of Francis Bacon, modern physics and chemistry was born. Today there are 119 elements, of which 92 are found naturally. </p>
<p>There were said to be four elements that founded the world: earth, air, fire, water, with aether added to that list. There were also a metaphorical three elements to describe life: salt (matter), sulfur (soul),
and mercury (spirit). Salt was seen as solid and remained coherent throughout processes; while sulfur changed dramatically when it underwent processes; mercury as a liquid metal at room temperature was
seen as being the closest conduit for that elusive spirit of life, which today would best be described as the elusive translation from genotype to phenotype. The battle between mind and body of Descartes and
onwards in the mind-brain problem is the metaphorical relationship between salt and sulfur. The terms have changed but the underlying issues remain.

<div class="title">Elementals of Paraclesus</div>
<div class="content">
<p>Within the Paracelsian system, an elemental is a mythic being described in occult and <a href="#alchemy">Alchemical</a>
 works from around the time of the European Renaissance and particularly elaborated upon in the 16th century works of Paracelsus. </p>
<P>From the classical Paracelsian perspective, there are four elemental categories corresponding respectively with the Classical elements of antiquity: </p>
<ul style="padding-left: 55px;">
<li>Gnomes <a href="#earth">Earth</a> </li>
<li>Salamanders <a href="#fire">Fire</a> </li>
<li>Sylphs <a href="#air">Air</a></li>
<li>Undines <a href="#water">Water</a></li></ul>
<p>Gnomes are the nature spirits who serve at the physical level.&nbsp; Billions of Gnomes tend the Earth through the cycles of 
the four seasons and see to it that all living things are supplied with their daily needs.&nbsp; On spiritual levels, the Gnomes have an even 
heavier chore, they must clean up the imprints of mankind's discord and negativity that remain at energetic levels in the Earth.</p>
<P>Salamanders serve at the smallest (today: atomic) level of all organic and inorganic life, infusing the little bits (today: molecules) of 
matter with the spiritual Fires of Creation. The Salamanders imbue the entire creation with the energies of the Spirit necessary to sustain life on Earth. Capable of wielding 
both the most intense Fires of the physical atom and the purifying, spiritual Fires of Spirit, they control the spiritual-material 
oscillation of light within the nucleus of every atom.</p>
<p>Sylphs tend the Air element, directing the flow of air currents and atmospheric conditions.&nbsp; They purify the atmosphere and aerate 
every cell of life with the sacred breath of Spirit.&nbsp; They are bearers of the life-sustaining breath that nourishes all living 
things.&nbsp; On subtle levels, sylphs transmit the currents of the Spirit from heaven to Earth.</p>
<p>Sylphs often have thin, ethereal bodies that transform gracefully into myriad shapes as they soar through the air.&nbsp; They are able to 
travel great distances very quickly, and giant sylphs can actually span the skies and interpenetrate the Earth, the Water and the Fire elements.</p>
<P>Undines have water as their domain. These beautiful, supple mermaid-like beings are subtle and swift in their movements and can change form rapidly.
The Undines control the tides and have much to do with the climate as well as oxygenation and precipitation.
They cleanse not only the physical waters, but also that aspect of mankind's life that relates to the water element, our emotional and subconscious world.</p>
<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that Paracelsus' holistic and artistic representation of forces of nature are intellectually courageous attempts to first name and then
understand the very outer limits of what is knowable, knowable even with today's modern science. For example, the Salamander reflect the vital force of life, which today remains a hidden question of the 
Law of Physical Nature of the translation of genotype to phenotype, in other words, how the DNA becomes an "alive" living organism. That modern science does not highlight this
limitation of its ability to describe reality and Paracelsus does highlight this boundares says a great deal about the character of contemporary modern scientists. </p>

<div class="title">Esoteric Organizations</div>
<div class="content">

<p>It turns out that philosophers and esotericists are great drinking buddies. While the approach may differ, the object of complete understanding of the workings of the world is by far the single most important objective of both. The inclusion of this esoteric dictionary is homage to all of those who sought informed, intelligent, artistic, holistic and scientific approaches to uncovering the mystery of being.</p>
<p>There has been a consistent drive by humans to understand the workings of the world. Before the advent of modern science, with Francis Bacon and Rene Decartes being the twin pillars of the modern repeatability||verifiability||measurability||falsifiability approach, all such efforts could be lumped under the title of philosophy. Today with the discovery of mathematical objects and with the modern experiments in quantum mechanics, we see that the world hides its mysteries to one and all. </p>

<p>Science as systematic investigation must be practiced with the confidence to first and loudest highlight what has not been and perhaps cannot be determined; in this, we maintain the necessary curiosity and humbleness needed to approach difficult questions with honesty and rigor. Thus, acceptance of unfinalizability should have been forthright with the awakening from dogmatic slumber that David Hume provided. Further, we should accept, given the startling findings of the Double Slit Experiment, that there is a carnivalization of human interaction and interplay with the universe, limited certainly by the Laws of Physical Nature but also limited by perhaps hidden forces within and outside of humans. </p>
<p>The following list, <a href="Esoteric_Organizations.html">Esoteric Organizations</a>, details some of the seekers of the very depths of the workings of the world, seeking for acausal connecting principles, serendipity, coincidence, causality and attempting to do artistically what Charles Sanders Pierce did logically: try to understand the world free of the symbols that one uses to describe the world. This appears to be as difficult a task as such use of symbols is so hard-wired into our being. We can perhaps only take a cue from  the apparent impossibility of Orpheus upon successfully exiting Hades with his beloved wife, Eurydice, to not look back. He did look back, and so Eurydice was not able to exit Hades. The question may be how to escape human consciousness in order to understand human consciousnesss without being influenced by human consciousness. Best of luck.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>The evil eye is a curse cast by a malevolent glare, often given to a person when that person is unaware of it. Many 
cultures, believing that receiving the evil eye will cause misfortune or injury, have created <a href="#amulets">talismans</a> to protect against it such as the phallic charm called 
 <i>fascinum</i>i>. 
<p>Similar "connections" between people are yawning, looking at people from a distance. Wild children also can develop certain extra-normal communication 
skills; see Genie the Wild Child.</p>
<p>Apollonides also reports women of this kind in Scythia, who are called the Bitiae, and Phylarchus
mentions also the Thibii tribe and many others of the same nature in Pontus,
whose distinguishing marks he records as being a double pupil in one eye and the
likeness of a horse in the other. . . Also among ourselves, Cicero states that the
glance of all women who have double pupils is injurious everywhere. In fact
when nature implanted in man the wild beast’s habit of devouring human flesh,
she also thought fit to implant poisons in the whole of the body, and with some
persons the eyes as well, so that there should be no evil anywhere that was not present in man.</p>

<div class="title">Fermi Paradox</div>
<div class="content">
<p>Nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi asked why given the 1) huge size of the universe, and 2) a reasonable probability that some intelligent life would develop and take
the perhaps 50 million years to colonize the galaxy that we see no evidence of contact with alien life. This issue is related with the Drake Formula. </p>
<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that Fermi was purposefully or inadvertently discounting the reports that he had read and the 6,000 year long experiential topology of descriptions of alien visits, and this
is understandable given the general dismiss of such ideas at that time. However, today, given that modern science through the <i>Michelson-Morley</i> and <i>Airy's Failure</i> experiments have shown the earth to be stationary, and other ground based experiments have shown it to be flat, we must postulate something completely different (knowing that some explanations of the results of the <i>Michelson-Morley</i> experiment rely on an unproven Special (or General) Theory of Relativity, while <i>Airy's Failure</i> cannot be answered by appeal to this unproven Theory). </p>
<p>Thus, the Archon Philosopher accepts as strongest evidence that visitions from non-human sentient creatures has been on-going and documented for 6,000 years, recently admitted by numerous air forces, including at the Pentagon, Washington D.C. We have not been openly visited, as earth is a node within a Type III Civilization, and it is in the interests of the leadership of that Type III Civilization that humans not be made explicitly aware. Though in the documented history of interaction and interpenetration of our space, it is clear there have been attempts to communicate certain ideas about the nature of the universe. <P>Thus, the Fermi Paradox is solved in that we have been consistently contacted, there has been consistent recording of this contact in serious and best ability terms, that this contact is not desirable for certain parties, and that there are likely important reasons why humans should not be currently be made aware of the actual shape and nature of the universe. These reasons have been detailed in <a href="#bookofages">the Book of Ages</a>.</p>

<div class="title">Field of Experience <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/lawsofphysicalnature.png"><img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/lawsofphysicalnature.png" title="Laws of Physical Nature" align="middle" width="100"></a></div>
<div class="content">
<p>The Archon Philosopher coined the term "Field of Experience" to denote the sum total of whatever and wherever it is that humans and another sentient beings are, in our shared existence. Based in a phenomonological approach, the Field of Experience includes the universe/world as the physical aspsect as experienced, accepting all psychological stances but bracketing them as essential but arbitarily chosen. But further, the Field of Experience also includes the <a href="#lawsofphysicalnature">Laws of Physical Nature</a> which are not "in" the universe but rather are "of" the universe, as these Laws surround and embrace the universe allowing the universe/world to be. Thus, the Laws of Physical Nature do not exist; and this is demonstratable as things that exist are able to be divided and stored within the universe, but one cannot divide and store a moment of time, for example. </p>

<p>What it means to be, to exist - the ontological question - is to be within the Field of Experience, to be a result of the interplay of the Laws of Physical Nature. To be conscious is to be aware of, and to respond to, stimuli; to be sentient, however, means to 1) firstly be aware of stimuli, but 2) to choose to lie about such awareness or not, and 3) to be able to communicate about such stimuli and response. There are graduations of consciousness from low level
to self-consciousness; but sentience is having a serious flexible playfulness about one's experience: ultimately, all sentient beings share the knowledge of living towards the horizon of eventual death.</p>

<p><figurer><img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/overhangofpretime.png" title="Overhang of Pre-time" align="middle" width="100"></figurer>

It should be noted that while the Laws of Physical Nature are rigidly connected to each other to allow for the stability of the universe and thus the sustainability of life, the Laws are misaligned such that with technology, sentient beings may gain glimpses of some of the structual features of the Field of Experience. Two main examples of this are the collapse of the wave function as seen in the <a href="#doubleslitexperiment">Double Slit Experiment</a>, and the <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/overhangofpretime.png">overhang of pre-time</a> in the <a href="#delayedchoicequantumeraserexperiment">Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment</a>. Other structural features include the <a href="Sacred_Geometry.html">Metaphysical Fields</a>, which are static and dynamic structures resulting from the interplay of the Laws of Physical Nature. Metaphysical Fields, such as the Lorzenz Attractor, are also known as <i>Sacred Geometry</i> and interpenetrate our world in large and small ways, but always preserving the Laws of Physical Nature.  </p>

<p>In mathematics and outside of mathematics, a generating function is a link between an object of study and its properties. This is normally conducted by placing a formal structure upon some series to gain some control over, or information about, say, coefficients or ordering of the series. However, we may expand this idea of formal structure to any collection of information bearing objects and a generating function merely highlights some otherwise difficult to discern aspects of those objects.</p>
 <p>All symbols serve as semantic generating functions, as do pictograms and most effectively, diagrams. In seeking to discover hidden relations among semantic objects and their worldly objects of referral, certain connections seem to elicit very effective uncovering of previously unseen connections. For example, one image-diagram of a Mandelbrot Set speaks volumes. Most interestingly, for any horizon, whether within a continuous or discontinuous system, whatever is after the horizon is a function of whatever is before the horizon. Thus with the correct, though perhaps obscure generating function, a glimpse across any given horizon, including that of death, may be achieved.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>The term <i>gnosis</i> refers to a knowledge as based on personal intellect, experience and perception; an ancient phenomenological approach.  
In a religious context, gnosis is a mystical or esoteric knowledge based on direct participation with the divine, the divine being human understanding of an
experience of ontology within the world, oneself and an experiential connection between these two ontologies.  </p>

<p>Gnosticism is the modern name for perhaps the most prominent of the syncretic religious movements of the ancient eastern Mediterrean region. At this <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/secondnexus.png">nexus</a> in history, two centuries before and after the birth of Jesus Christ, the recent Greek metaphysics and ontology of both the Platonics and Pre-Socratics merged into the echos of
Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Persian experiences of their gods, as well as the emerging monothesisms of <a href="#zoroaster">Zoroaster</a>, and <a href="#abraham">Abraham</a>, with the startling figure of Jesus heavily influencing contemporary discourse.</p>

<p>The <a href="./archonphilosopherweblibrary/NaghammadiTexts.pdf"><i>Nag Hammadi texts</a></i>, unearthed in the 1940s, have provided a secure textual basis for solidifying the idea of a god behind god (God),
mentioned as the <em>Demiurge</em> in Plato's <i>Timeaus</i>, and reflecting the pre-deluge (ante-Deluvian) descriptions of the Egyptian <a href="#ptah">Ptah</a>, Mesopotamian <a href="#nammu">Nammu</a>,
and Persian <a href="#zurvan">Zurvan</a>. These early experiences were appropriated by Greeks in their primordial myths of Chaos thrusting out
Gaia and Uranus as a fusion of the later myths of Mesopotamian Tiamat and the Anunaki, of the <a href="MysteriesoftheTwiceBorn.html#osirisisis">Egyptian Osiris story</a>, and of the <a href="MysteriesoftheTwiceBorn.html#mithras">Mithric Saga</a>.</p>

<P>Untangling the ante-Deluvian direct experiencing, as noted in the <i>Book of Enoch</i> and other apocraphal texts, from the retellings is difficult. As well, the abstractions
of the Greek metaphysics and ontology is distanced from the actual experiences, also leading Gnostic Schools in different directions. In addition, while the idea of a 
god behind god (God) may be common, non-Gnostic sects, such as the Pauling-Marcion Nexus, also promoted the <em>Demiurgic</em> ideas, well before the 
Neoplatonists sought their synthesis of abstract metaphysics with temporally locatable gods.</p>

<p>While Manichean thought may be described, as per Augustine, as dualistic in moral terms, adoption of the <em>Demiurgic</em> creation of the physical world
removes the "problem of evil" issue that plagues a creator of intellectualized omnipotence. Differing  gnostic schools went in opposing directions as regards the Socratic 
moral "goodness" of the <em>Demiurge</em> and <em>Archons</em>, with some describing the <em>Archons</em> as good angels and others as fallen angels, or demons.</p>

<p>Current experiences of non-human consciousnesses in the video taped, radar tracked, multiple-credible eye-witness testimony of Unidentified Aerial
Phenomenon as publicly confirmed by the Pentagon in its <a href="#aatip">AATIP Program</a>, have revived the <em>Demiurgic</em> approach, especially in light of the Nag Hammadi 
texts. This direct experiencing extends well beyond military to thousands of credible experiences, documented back through history to the aforementioned
Book of Enoch and dozens of other texts in that area of the world dating back to 6,000 years ago. </p>

<P>It is the position of the <em>Archon Philosopher</em> that the ancient descriptions of actual involvement by non-human consciousnesses refect the same
forces or entities that currently appear in the skies today and which currently interact with humans in a number of ways. Thus the need for better understanding
of the wide range of issues is needed.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>The Strophalos, or Hecate's Wheel is an ancient Greek symbol and emblem of the initiatory lunar goddess Hecate, in her triple aspect. Only one ancient source remains to shed any light on this emblem's meaning.</p>
<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> century CE Alexandrian text known as the <i>Chaldean Oracle</i> 
describes the emblem as a labyrinthine serpent (also emblematic of rebirth) surrounding a spiral. This is symbolic of the Iynges, those lesser beings that inhabit the spaces between the primordial triad of the Chaldeans and the physical world. 
These Iynges are 'whirlings' or emanations of divine thought.</p>
<p>For the Archon Philosopher, these "lesser beings" would be described as metaphysical entities, such as the Lorenz Attractors, the Fibonacci Series, Mandelbrot formulaes, Pi, and other mathematical and physics constraints that pattern the physical and non-physical aspects of the <em>Field of Experience</em>. The spiral, as introduced under <a href="#amulets">amulets and talismans</a>, is the dynamism of the system, and sigils, letters, amulets, and other signs are keys to moving through labyrinths. As solutions - mathematical, artistic, holistic and otherwise, the sigils reveal the patterns by which communities, people and the the physical universe itself repeat or rhyme through each iteration of its pattern. Momentarily stumbling across a certain mathematical connection between a metaphysical entity and the world allows a brief but powerful ability to gain insight into current unfolding action; however, even short term prediction ceases as each labyrinth morphs within the constant dynamism of the physical system. Those connections between a metaphysical entity and the world which do not change are those connections which adhere between the pre-ontological Laws of Physical Nature and the <em>Field of Experience</em>.

Hermeticism is a philosophical and esoteric tradition based primarily upon writings attributed to <a href="#hermestrismegistus">Hermes Trismegistus</a>
  (Thrice Great).These writings have greatly influenced the Western esoteric tradition and were reintroduced into Western consciousness via Marsilio Ficino
 in the late 1400s.Hermeticism claims descent from an ancient doctrine that affirms the existence of a single, true theology that is present in all religions and that was given to man in antiquity.</p>

<p>Hermes Trismegistus is a syncretic combination of the Greek god <a href="#hermes">Hermes</a> and the Egyptian 
god <a href="#thoth">Thoth</a>.  Greeks in Hellenistic Egypt recognised the equivalence of Hermes and Thoth, so the two gods were worshiped as one in what had been the Temple of Thoth in Khemnu, Hermopolis for Greeks.  Both 
Hermes and Thoth were gods of writing and magic in their respective cultures.  Hermes, the Greek god of interpretive communication, was 
combined with Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom, to become the patron of astrology and alchemy.  In addition, both gods were Psychopomps, guiding souls to the afterlife.</p>
<p>An account of how Hermes Trismegistus got the name <i>Thrice Great</i> is derived from the <i>Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus</i>, 
wherein it is stated that he knew the three parts of the wisdom of the whole universe:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#alchemy">Alchemy</a></li>
<li><a href="#Astrology">Astrology</a></li>
<li><a href="#theurgy">Theurgy</a></center></li></ul>

<p>The Emerald Tablet, also known as the Smaragdine Table and Tabula Smaragdina, is a compact and deep exposition of universal relationships including of the <i>prima materia</i> and its 
transmutation, oft cited for its penetrating insight of "As Above, So Below" . Many other penetrating texts are attributed to Hermes Trismegistus.</p>
<p><a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/hermeticismpanel.png">Hermeticism</a> has magical, philosophical, alchemiac, and astrological strands from Egyptian, Greek, then Roman, Byzantine and Arab sources. Seeking to understand hidden connections, 
Hermetic approaches stimuated the rise of modern scientific investigations, pure mathematics and what could be called the speculative thought of current chaos theories and theoretical 
physics. Similar approaches can be found from the Eastern Western Civilization of Persia and Mesopotamia under the Chaldean Oracles, Neo-Platonists and pre-Biblical writings. </p>
<p>The Archon Philosopher views/speculates that Thoth/Thoth/Orpheus/Hermes Trismegistus/Cadmus/ as a remnant of the Demiurges' first generation of earth overseers, known to the ancient Greeks as the Titans. Thoth, one of the <a href="#archons"> Archons = Visible Angels = Aliens</a> was a survivor of the deluge (along with Mede, Mithra, Seth, Og, Aeneas, Melchizedek, the Tage of Etruscia and Nimrod) and sought to fulfill his alloted and personal mission to: 1) inform humans of the interpenetration of the Archons in human
affairs, 2) fulfill the mission of humans to understand their world, and 3) assist in the human's alloted task to collapse wave-functions of this understanding. </p>

<p>The Latin acronym or initialism INRI stands for <em>Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum</em> and represents the Latin inscription in the New Testament John 19:19 which, in English, reads as 'Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews' 
and John 19:20 states that this was written in three languages Hebrew, Latin, and Greek during the crucifixion of Jesus. The Greek version of the initialism reads INBI.</p>
<figurel><img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/inri2.gif" title="INRI" align="left" width="200"></figurel>
<p>The title 'King of the Jews' is only used in the New Testament by Gentiles, namely by the Magi, Pontius Pilate, and the Roman

<p>The <em>Pentagrammaton</em> is another common set of initials stemming from the Tetragrammaton "יהוה‎", but adding a shin in the middle to form "יהשוה", transliterated as  Yeshua (Yahshuah), the Hebrew Biblical name Joshua. This

The <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/lawsofphysicalnature.png"><em>Laws of Physical Nature</em></a> must be distinguished from the "laws of physics". The materialist "laws of physics" are restricted as they apply only to physical entities within the world, whereas the <em>Laws of Physical Nature</em>, while including all of those laws, include those laws, such as Time, which are required for a physical world but cannot be investigated by physics experimentation. Thus while the laws of physics may need to consider the non-material Laws of Physical Nature of <i>Time</i>, <i>Causality</i>, <i>Consciousness</i>, or the stablizing <i>Connectedness</i>, they are effectively not able to conduct experiments on them or for them or with them; as they are with <i>Materiality</i>, <i>Spatiality</i>, and <i>Electromagnetism</i>, <i>Entanglement</i>, <i>Gravity</i>. The <em>Law of Physical Nature</em> <i>Translation of Genotype to Phenotype</i> remains a complete mystery.</p>

<p>Further, it must be admitted that language and the cognitive structures of humans do not and cannot finalize the description of the <em>Laws of Physical Nature</em>, but given the long term success of humans in sustaining their existence based on those languages and cognitive structures, obviously these <em>Laws of Physical Nature</em> are effective and viable descriptions: truth as demonstrated lived life. </p>

<div class="content">
<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that the Law of Unintended Consequences is not a <em>Law of Physical Nature</em>, but rather is a <em>metaphysical entity</em> which reflects the Kabbalistic Sephirotic "shattering" or the <em>unfinalizability</em> as the Laws of Physical Nature "organize themselves/unfold themselves" in the (backward and current) cascading of the metaphysical structure of the lived-in world. </p>

<p>We today speak of risk, good fortune and bad luck, and of freewill: these are features of the cascading interplay of the metaphysical <em>Laws of Physical Nature</em> and of the <em>metaphysical entities</em> within the <em>Field of Experience</em>, which together provide the shape of the physical lived-in world. Ultimately in order to have the universe as imagined in the <em>overhang of pre-time</em> as originarily imagined by the Demiurge, the structure of the universe includes an artistic/holistic perspective of this sentient creature through its access to its own future individuated consciousness.  Consciousness - one of the Laws of Physical Nature, is equiprimordial to the other Laws and thus consciousness cannot "finalize" the other Laws of Physical Nature, leading to the inability of consciousness (intellect) to come to any final description of events, and in reflecting the operation of the lived-in world thus describing how freewill/risk is introduced into the world.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>A magical weapon is any instrument that will transform reality, or more often, perception of reality to allow greater power over the world. In usual practice, magical weapons are very
specific and consecrated items used within formalized ritual and procedure. There is no hard and fast rule as to what constitutes or does not constitute a magical weapon -- if a magician considers 
it to be a weapon, then a weapon it is.</p>
<p>There does exist, however, a historical set of magical weapons with particular uses and symbolic meanings: 
<i>Dagger/Sword</i>, <i>Wand/Baton</i>, <i>Cup/Chalice</i>, <i>Paten/Disc</i>, <i>Pentacle</i>, <i>Holy Oil/Oil of Abramelin</i>, <i>Scourge</i>, <i>Chain</i>, <i>Altar</i>, <i>Lamp and Bell</i>, <i>Book</i>, <i>Candle</i>. </p>
<figurela><a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/fifth root of unity.png"><img src="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/fifth root of unity.png" title="Matheo-Scientific Magical Weapons" align="middle" width="100"></a></figurela>
<p><i>The Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage</i> consists of one-part myrrh, two-parts cinnamon, a half-part galangal root, and half the total weight of the best olive oil.</p>
<p>However, magical weapons include less obvious means for transformation: <a href="#generatingfunction">generating functions</a>, <a href="#doubleslitexperiment">Double Slit Experiment</a>, <a href="#delayedchoicequantumeraserexperiment">Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment</a>, application of any one of the metaphysical entities, scopes, forces of electromagnetism: any technology that sufficiently advanced would be seen 'as magic' by a sufficiently less advanced culture. </p>
<p>William S Burroughs described magic as <i>will</i>. In this regard, it is the position of the Archon Philosopher that <i>will</i> as a function of an individuated consciousness has relation with the Law of Physical Nature consciousness. To the extent to which this Law of Physical Nature consciousness is adaptable by participation by all individuated conscious creatures, one can rend the fabric of consciousness and effect changes on the whole. To do this, however, successfully would require powers unknown, and a topology of consciousness that would allow for one small effort on one side to "pull" the whole of this topological manifold of consciousness sufficiently that some "magical" result is generated in requiring another individuated conscious creature to amend its consciously chosen behavior and carry out this act of willing. </p>

<div class="content">
<p>Mandragora, a plant genus belonging to nightshade family Solanaceae, known as mandrakes) was included in numerous magical potions. All species of Mandrake contain highly biologically active alkaloids, tropane alkaloids in particular, making the plant, both root and leaves, hallucinogenic and hypnotic and in sufficient quantity, poisonous via anticholinergic.</p>
<p>Many myths and legends surround the mandrake, which was said to resemble a naked human body.&nbsp; Among the many superstitions surrounding the 
plant was the belief that it was propagated by the blood of the condemned, and would grow prolifically underneath the gallows.</p>

<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that consciousness is a Law of Physical Nature and that human consciousness, as an example in a sentient creature of a necessary microcosm of the macrososm of consciousness, will be affected by a variety of chemical agents, as well as other "shocks" to the brain. This is due to the connection point between a individuated sentient creature's physical structure and a flow of consciousness able to "latch" onto that necessary physical junction box: damage the junction box and one damages the access to consciousness. 

<p>Thus, sufficiently changing the brain reshuffles the Kantian <i>Categories of Thought</i> [Cognitive Structures] so as to restructure understanding of and thus ability to control the world. Some of these changes are obviously non-sustainable and prevent sustainability; however, insights gained and new methods for organizing understandings of the world via Mandrakes or other substance is akin to a magical (deeply transformative) experience. These events as <i>Peak Experiences</i> are common but so unsettling that most people prefer to ignore these events when they occur, while maintaining life-long memories of these experiences. While the exact mechanism of effect will be ultmately unfinalizable, as is the connection between brain and mind, the introduction of chemicals that can be seen clearly to affect the brain, demonstrate that the brain is the seat of the mind. However, these types of pursuits allow for an understanding of a multi-consciousness universe.</p>

<div class="content">
<p><a href="finalpapers/AnaximanderofMiletus.pdf">Anaximander of Miletus</a> was the first great metaphysician. He sought a rational explanation for the cause, or principle, of everything and anything, postulating the "undefined-unlimited" as the underlying cause of everything. The Greeks at that time, roughly 2,500 years ago, had adopted and adapted the Egyptian, Persian, Phoenician and Mesopotamian polythesistic explanation of gods with powers arising from the <i>Chaos</i>, focussing on moral or dramatic relationships or epic connections with the world. But the matter of why there was any god at all was left hidden in the mists of ancient stories of jealous, emotional, divine personalities and the forces they weilded. With his teacher Thales, and Anaximines, both from Miletus, Anaximander began the quest to rationally answer the metaphysical question that was taken up by Heraclius, Parmenides, and others in Greece, until Socrates redirected (misdirected) this critical thinking power into the more profitable and less important area of moral questions and language games. </p>

<p>While moral questions of right and wrong do belong to philosophy under the rubric of ethics, no moral question can adequately be answered until one knows where one is. Right or wrong, good or bad, rely on a understanding of where one is: if one is in a prison, moral questions are answered differently than if one were in paradise, or in a divine testing ground, or livestock on a farm, on in a computer simulation, or in hell or in heaven and so on and so on. Thus, by jumping ahead into questions that cannot be answered, the Wider Western Civilization has been hijacked from uncovering its whereabouts. </p>

<p>Metaphysics is the science that seeks a coherent explanation of why there is anything, including <i>Being</i> or the <i>Being-of-anything</i>. 
<div style="padding-left: 122px; width: 400px;">
<ul>
<li>Philosophy seeks a rigorous and clear explanation of all intersubjectively verifiable matters experienced in the lived-in world. Knowledge is judged according to epistemological standards and only the strongest and most stable of knowledge claims are admitted, or at least admitted into discussion without qualification. The sum total of the explanation must cohere with itself, without the necessity to believe wholly unproven elements. As the subject matter resides in the past, modern science can only be used to support testable matters in the present. 
<li>Religions tend to assume or postulate or decree a supernatural entity that does not abide by the natural forces (thus "super"-natural) but who when creates everything for reasons that are fully understandable only to that divine entity. </li>
<li>Modern science has stumbled outside of its proper bounds and mistakenly allowed astrophysics into its fold, thus undermining confidence in science and unabashedly introducing incoherent and ad hoc theories to explain everything including the magical big bang theory, with its incoherent and equally magical "gravitational singularity theory", and other fanciful conjectures such as dark matter/dark energy. </li>
<li>Mystics and other esoterics seek an explanation of everything through imprecise experiences and feathery connections between events and minds, concerned more about impressions than intersubjectively verifiable data.</li></ul></p></div>

<div class="content">
<P>Numbers are the content of mathematical formula and sentences. Numbers are described and organized in <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/mathnumbers.png">
sets of numbers</a>, each enclosing the previous. Like all symbolic representations of reality, numbers do not always exactly reflect 
the lived-in-world, and formula rely on assumptions and abstraction and sometimes approach paradox or a non-defined quality. </p>

<P>We may best think of natural numbers (positive intergers) as adjectives: as in one potato, two potatoes, three potatoes, and eventually
the Incans, for example, would have just removed the noun "potatoes".  Negative intergers add an absence idea. Rational numbers which are ratios of
natural numbers either resolve or have repeating decimals, but ultimately remain tied to the lived-in-world. Irrational numbers come in two varieties, with
Algebraic Irrational at some point being able to solve a polynomial equation (root one axis to zero), with the other, Transcendental Numbers, being completely
divorced from any connection to either the lived-in-world or for solving any polynomial. And yet, Transcendental Numbers are critical to describing the world,
though we can never arrive (apparently) at a final determination of these numbers. For example &#x2107;	Euler's Number, &Pi; Pi, and perhaps the Feigenbaum Constant. 
The <i>i</i> imaginary  number reflects something akin to a parallel fantasy world, where the 4<sup>th</sup> power of <i>i</i> equates to 1, that is to unity. </p>
<P>The unresolvability in either understanding or mathematically of Imaginary, Transcendental and (most) Irrational Numbers points to issues of <a href="#unfinalizability">unfinalizability</a>. 
They are useful in the world, but are ultimately not of the world, and perhaps that is why Descartes named the set of all of these numbers "real", an unintuitive name for 
symbols some of which have no exact referent on earth.</p>

<p>The Orphic Egg within the Ancient Greek Orphic tradition is the Cosmic Egg from which hatched the primordial hermaphroditic golden-winged deity Phanes, who in

<p>Called 'Protogonos' (First-Born) and Eros (Love) --  being the seed of gods and men -- Phanes means 'Manifestor' or 'Revealer', and is related to the Greek words 'light'. </p><BR>
<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that this Orphic story is a description of the Demiurge (cited as "Artisan" by Plato in his final work <i>Timaeus</i>) creating the universe from the overhang of
pre-time (the Cosmic Egg/Pleroma), as we see today in the <a href="#delayedchoicequantumeraserexperiment">Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment</a>. This radical departure from the classic Greek mythology does lead one to suspect that this story had
a personal and non-Greek inception. That is, that this story arose from the authentic experience of the ancient Egyptians, Persians or Mesopotamians and became both enhanced and changed in the Greek Orphic retelling.</p>

<p>It is the position of the Archon Inquisitor that the serpent squeezing the <a href="#orphicegg">Cosmic

the Serpent as Abraxas, the movement from the pleromic void of infinite potentiality into a physical plane is an eternal and consistent force within this universe. </p>

<p>A serpent that devours a serpent is a change that stops change - death, destruction, decay, the devil. And yet,
at times, it is necessary to stop a process for an obvious greater good. Thus a self-created dragon - an ouroboros - can be a valiant, a hidden force for righteousness. </I></p>

<div class="content">
<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that the quest for all encompassing knowledge and power (The Great Work), known recently as becoming master of space and time, is a noble and difficult quest. The destination of this
quest was known by <a href="#alchemy">Alchemists</a> as the Philosopher's Stone, and by theosophists as changing base animal nature into divine nature within humans. </p>
<p>During the middle ages, philosophy was also focused on experimentation on physical objects in a physics and chemistry sense, and a philosopher's stone was that power able to transmut one substance into another. 
However, just after the time of Francis Bacon, philosophy was divided with metaphysics and epistemology separated clearly from the paths of materialist investigations, known early on as <i>natural philosophy</i> and then with the Scientific Method of Francis Bacon, physics and chemistry became Modern Physics and Modern Chemistry.</p>
<p>Naïve materialists and physicists have attempted to transmute non-being into being through ad hoc and at time incoherent materialisms of big bangs, and dark matter or energy in a variety of
attempts to materialistically understand and explain where we are. Such a superficial approach to ontology will necessarily fail. It is the intention of the Archon Philosopher to uncover this grand mystery and to unchain the answer from naïve materialists or other semi-theorists. If a theory will not explain everything, then it cannot be the Philosopher's Stone. </p>

<div class="content">
<p>The lights in the sky have had numerous descriptions. Today in the Wider Western Civilization there are three main descriptions. The "standard model" describes the lights in the sky
as both stars and planets formed of large amounts of matter, respectively emitting and reflecting light. This description follows from the Copernican Hypothesis and the Big Bang theory. Another description is
that a singular all powerful God of Abraham created these lights as objects. The third description is that mot of the lights are emanations on a dome ceiling, with the sun and moon as relatively nearby objects within the dome. </p>

<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that as both the Big Bang and God hypotheses are magical conjectures, they must be dismissed as not best explanation. Given the metaphysical originary source as a collapse of a wave-function 
by a member of the Demiurgic species and evidence of very advanced technology over a 6,000 period, best explanation looks toward humans as within a node in a Type III Civilization. The star lights are thus electromagnetic waves from the 
dome ceiling - note that if all wave forms are "seen", the whole sky becomes completely washed in "light". The planets as wandering planets reflect navigational centerpoints for one of the Archonic Watchers, as they navigate in our space. The sun and
moon are homebases for the main Watchers/Mentors/Archons, serving multiple purposes including energy provider and unavoidable stimulant for thought.  Thus, almost all the lights in the sky are projections on a 
<a href="#dysonsphere">Dyson-like Sphere</a> by a Type III Civilization.</p>

<p>Given the powerful impact of the lights on human creativity, history records numerous systems to explain the impact and source. While there is no way of ascertaining the degree of correlation between a given planet and involvement by a 
particular Archon or indeed of the Demiurge, as generating functions, the stories and connections point to attempts to explain hidden forces within our world. It may been noticed that while today we measure specific regular cycles of the sun in Solar Maximums and Solar Minimums, this does not stretch back forever in geological records - thus we should not misapply the <a herf="#uniformity">Principle of Uniformity</a>. Also, there are Grand Solar Maximums and Grand Solar Minimums, each corresponding to Grand Cosmic Ray Minimums and Grand Cosmic Ray Maximums, respectively. The connection of space weather (sun) on human physical and mental health has been documented and we can see larger trends with the Spoorer Minimum driving the insanity of the Great Flagellation Movements of the 1250s and 1350s, but later leading to the massively important intellectual feats of the Copernical Hypothesis and Francis Bacon's Scientific Method, founding modernity. </p>

<p>Within a Type III Civilization, it would be possible to harness the power of the sun, and to some extent control the cycles of the sun - however it may generate or collect and redirect energy. Thus, the space of humans (earth) is likely interchangeably pumped up and rationed in terms of magnetic waves and cosmic rays - periodically driving insanity and massive intellectual creativity and then calming things down, pushing humans to achieve the next level, whatever that may be in the conception of the Demiurge and Archons.</p> 

<p>The main issue about the lights in the sky would be why this configuration and not some other. In a Type III Civilization, there was likely experimentation with more simple configurations; thus, in the opinion of the Archon Philosopher, earth is a later construction as it exhibits a high level of complexity in both the land-sea configuration and in the sophistication of the lights in the sky. This investment of resources in the human space would imply some contribution by humans to respond positively to this investment. This response is likely a massive response involving the greatest of human powers - the collapse of wave-function in a specifically human way of doing so. This specifically human way is to view the lights in the sky, understand them thus gaining information, and then collapsing an actual universe as understood outside of the dome wall.  This was described in my first book: <i>The Book of Ages</i> <i><small>A Multi-consciousness Metaphysics</small></i>. 


<p>We may look at the traditional 7 Ancient Planets and add in other wanderers as greater or lesser influences by the shifting alliances of Archons, without assuming too much association with specifically ancient Greek understandings of those gods (Archons).

<p>For <a href="#alchemy">alchemists</a>, salt is allegorical for the physical body, the counterpart to <a href="#mercury">mercury</a> for spirit and <a href="#sulphur">sulphur</a> for soul. In the effort to penetrate these different forces in the world through the best self-referential examplar, investigators attempted to synthesize an understanding based upon an experimental approach leaving a <a href="#hermeticism">hermetic</a>, holistic, understanding. Salt is that element of substance and physicality which starts out being coarse and impure, then through alchemical processes is broken down by dissolving then purified and eventually re-formed into pure salt as a result of the interactions between mercury and sulphur.

<p>This allegorical, at time pictoral, understanding is in sharp distinction to the methodological precision and limitations of the scientific method. This method eventually separated out from philosophy proper, first known as <i>natural philosophy</i> and then as <i>modern science</i>. However, these limitations and materialism of the modern sciences has led to an unfortunate combination faith and arrogance encroaching upon modern science, coupled with incoherent theorizing in non-materialist subjects far outside of the limitations of the scientific method. This error is known as scientism.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>The history of creating sigils/letters/pictograms/glyphs/icons/symbols to reflect thought and re-present ideas of the world is 6,000 years long, dating back to
Cuneiform, Egyptian Hieroglyphics and moving forward in alphabets and in secret alphabets. </p>

<p> A list of secret alphabets <a href="./finalpapers/EsotericScripts.pdf"> is here</a>.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of the Archon Philosopher that esoteric scripts and the lines of any script or alphabet sooner or later by necessity will reflect one of the
metaphysical entities such as the Fibonacci Series or Lorenz Attractor, and will also by necessity accidentally "connect" with any possible written (and verbal) 
communications of non-human sentient creatures. Just as once in a while a word of one language mirrors the word of another language
(with only an incredibly rare occurence of the same meaning), there will be symbols, signs, letters, sigils and the utterance thereof which luck
would have it are recognized by non-human sentient creatures. </p>

<p>Apparently, by turning letters and by doing so consistently, the letters and 
configurations of the letters may (and may eventually have to) mirror the effect of metaphysical entities operating in the world or reflect some
pigeon language of angels/Archons/aliens, or gain a momentary glimpse through constructive or destructive interference of the network of hidden connections and artistic or holistic images of the functioning of the <em>Field of Experience</em>.

<p>Solomon's knot is the most common name for a traditional decorative motif used since ancient times, and found in many cultures.

<p>Solomon's knot consists of two closed loops, which are doubly interlinked in an interlaced manner.&nbsp; When laid flat, the knot is seen to have four crossings where the two loops interweave under and over each other.&nbsp; This contrasts with two crossings in the simpler Hopf link -- in mathematical knot theory, the Hopf link is the simplest nontrivial link with more than one component.</p>

<p>The Stèle of Revealing, known also as Stèle 666, is an ancient Egyptian funerary artefact of Ankh-af-na-Khonsu, from Thebes, around the time of the XXVI Dynasty. </p>
<p>This artefact played a key role in the creation of the philosophy and religion known as Thelema, and according to Aleister Crowley, his wife Rose had reported a revelation from the god <a href="#horus">Horus</a>,
 through his messenger Aiwass. Crowley took her to the Boulaq Museum in Cairo, Egypt (now the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, the Egyptian Museum, or the Museum of Cairo) to see if Rose could recognise Horus, which she did as an image on a painted Stèle which bore the catalogue number 666.</p>
<p>The Stèle is made of wood and covered with a plaster gesso, which has been painted. It measures 51.5 centimetres high and 31 centimetres
 wide.

<div class="content">
<p>The astronomical and astrological symbol for the Sun is a shield with a <a href="#circle">Circle</a>
 inside. Under the standard model, the Sun is an energy self-generator at the centre of a system of physical bodies, including earth, revolving around it. Due to a variety of incoherent theoretical 
speculations, the standard model is no longer tenable.</p>

<p>The sun is by far the most important source of energy for life on <a href="#earth">Earth</a>, as recognized by many pantheons of many cultures including a sun deity as a main deity.</p>

<p>In astrology, the Sun is the ruler of <a href="#leo">Leo</a>. Paracelsus assigns the heart as the vital organ of the Sun.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of the Archon Philosopher that the silence with which Eddington's incoherent theory of the sun creating energy by means of nuclear fusion is evidence of the dread underlying contemporary scientism. Rather than announce clearly and boldly
that this fusion conjecture was wrong to have been firstly accepted in the first place and then pronounced and then repeated as a "scientific finding", the "scientific community" is surreptiously hiding their lack of academic and intellectual honesty while attacking those who point this out. This bespeaks propaganda and not truth-seeking, and is a great sadness on the edifice built by Francis Bacon and so many others. </p>

<p>It is also the position of the Archon Philosopher that earth is a node within a Type III Civilization, founded by the species of the Demiurge and managed with a great number of other nodes by the Archons, who serve as Watchers, mentors, Guardians, angels. Within this node, the sun serves as the power source as well as inviting intellectual growth for humans as well as a tool for the control over behaviour in release of magnetic fields, cosmic rays, and large plasma discharges (the Deluge). In a double deception, it is in the interest of the Demiurge and Archons to actively discourage full understanding of the space of earth. Thus we see total hostility to any propogating that the Copernican Hypothesis is not correct; we also see massive support in funding and media coverage in any attempt to discover dark energy or dark matter and support of the standard model; and we witness a host of military and control structures to prevent humans from venturing to independently discover the shape of their world. </p>

<p>Tarot Cards have been called a "philosophic machine", meaning that through the systemic framework the random placement of meaningful cards uncovers answers (and questions) to philosophic issues. In this mystical approach to allow knowledge to flow in, rather than assertively seek out knowledge, unexpected connections will be uncovered, along with much that is frankly irrelevant. In this, Tarot is like the vast majority of sciences: providing no secure predictability but in the absence of better information, can provide an impetus for any action rather than stasis. </p>
<p>The history of the Tarot is mired in the mists of forgot time, but certainly evidence of the cards being used in some fashion occurs in Europe by the 1400s, with the first mention in <i>Sermones de ludo cum aliis</i> or Sermons of games with dice, written by a Dominican friar, dated to between 1450 and 1480. Needless to say, the Tarot cards provide yet another numerical system that integrates other esoteric systems in the quest to uncover the mystery of being.</p>

<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that language appears in multiple <a href="./finalpapers/phoenicianlanguage.pdf">symbol forms</a>, including geometric forms. These "languages" may not be decipherable by humans but may form some ability for other sentient creatures: though there may be a means of translation.

The metaphysical entity Pi, &Pi, fosters the transcendence of the circle, and if there is any symbolic allegorical or intential "presense" of a circle, incribing one would draw that structure of our lived-in world closer. This seems all quite mystical and yet there is some grounding to this. Symbols, like notes in music, seem to speak directly. </p>

Thus the appeal to best explanation of the history of humans no longer is easily determined as an algorithmic process of survival of those creatures who fit into their environment. However, it is clear going forward for humans, that only those humans which can fit into their environment will have children that have children; and thus the Theory of Evolution is true going forward in time, testable going forward in time and almost tautological as going forward in time. </p>

<p>Appeals to back-date the Theory of Evolution while claiming the confidence and certainty of <i><b>modern science</b></i> is to bring the Theory of Evolution into disrepute and pseudoscience.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>The Uraeus is the serpent emblem found in Egyptian portrayals of royalty  and deity. It is a symbol of divine authority, representing the 
goddess Wadjet as the All-seeing  Eye of Ra, who was believed to protect the pharaohs by spitting fire, and the emblem of the Lower Kingdom of Egypt. According to legend, the 
cobra was given to the pharaohs as a sign of kingship by the god Geb.
<p>Pharaohs wore the Uraeus as a head ornament, either with the body of  Wadjet atop the head, or as a crown encircling the head. This 
indicated Wadjet's protection and reinforced the pharaoh's claim over the land. In whatever manner the Uraeus was displayed upon the 
pharaoh's head, it was, in effect, part of his crown. The pharaoh was recognised only by the wearing of the Uraeus, which conveyed legitimacy to the ruler.</p>

<p>In the Copernican system, Uranus is the seventh planet from the <a href="#sun">Sun</a>. While being 'visible' to the naked eye, it was not recognised as a planet due to its light being dim and its slow orbit. Uranus became the first planet discovered by William Herschel on 13 March 1981 with the use of his homemade 6'2" reflecting telescope. The planet
 is tipped over on its side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees, and is often described as 'rolling around the Sun on its side'.</p>

<p>Vesta was the goddess of the hearth, the centre of the Roman home. She was the protector of the sacred flame, which was supposed to have

had to remain priestesses for thirty years, and were not allowed to marry.
<p>In Roman homes, every day during a meal a small cake was thrown on the fire for Vesta -- it was supposed to be good luck if it burnt with a crackle.

<p>Wadjet was one of the earliest Egyptian deities and was often depicted

<p>She was one of the goddesses given the title Eye of Ra. It was in this form that she was sent out to avenge her father and almost caused 
the destruction of mankind. Humanity was saved when she was tricked with some beer which had been dyed red with pomegranate juice to resemble blood.</p>
<p>She was closely linked to the principle of <a href="#maat">Ma'at</a> (justice or balance). Before being crowned as king, <a href="#geb">Geb</a> attacked and raped his mother Tefnut.
When he went to take his place as pharaoh and put the Royal <a href="#uraeus">Uraeus</a> on his own forehead, the snake reared up and attacked the god and his 
followers. The whole of Geb's retinue died and Geb himself was badly injured. Clearly, his actions were against Ma'at, and Wadjet was not prepared to allow him to go unpunished.</p>

<p>Astromomically, the path that the <a href="#sun">sun </a> makes through the background stars as seen from earth is known as the zodiac; astrologically, this path reflects
those 12 constellations of stars during the time of the ancients. The ancient Mesopotamians, Egyptians and Greeks all developed elaborate systems, with the Greeks inheriting 
ideas from the others about the divinity underlying those constellations of stars. </p>

<P>In astrology, at one's birth each of the twelve houses represents the position of the heavens at the time of a person’s birth, via which each person is assigned certain personality
traits and other characteristics reflecting the patterns of heavenly bodies at the moment of entry into worldly experience, as well as outlining a pathway forward
through events during the lifetime.</p>

<p>It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that the stars of the heavens are a fractal image and artistic trace of the mind of the Archon responsible for constructing the node of earth within the Type III Civilization of the Demiurgic species. As such, to the extent to which that fractal image is a template for or mirror image of or coincidental pattern for other constructions on earth or within the Field of Experience, then an evaluation of such cosmic tropes as the design of this fractal may lead to gleaning some information about the path of one's possible experience. Analogy is sometimes an informing tool of logic, and sometimes the value is negligible. Sometimes one lives out the heraldry of one's ancestors. </p>
