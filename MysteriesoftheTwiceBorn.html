<H1>Mystery Processions: Twice-born Dionysius, Twice-Born Osiris, Twice-Born Jesus, Twice-Born Demiurge</h1>


<span style="font-size: 28px; padding-bottom: 55%;">The Twice Born: 1) into the physical world; then 2) into a mystic-spiritual world. </span> <BR>
<span style="font-size: 28px; padding-bottom: 55%;">The Twice Born: 1) into an individualized materialized lived-life; and 2) into a shared universe of the Laws of Physical Nature. </span> 
<p class="intro" style="padding-top: 1%;">This process(ion) mirrors the 1999 Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment where 2) what is seen in the overhang of pre-time (the mystic-spiritual world) is then 1) instantiated into the physical world as the lived-in universe. The structural features of the universe encloses the participants in this large <i>Procession of Consciousness</i> through the various possibilities formed by the interplay of the Laws of Physical Nature, Metaphysical Mathematical Fields, and the materialized opportunity for experience. </p>
 
<center>
<blockquote>Within this universe, there "exists" no abstract process [abstractions have no power to effect] but rather only a materilized procession making its way from birth to death and sometimes beyond [an actual event, experienceable and experienced, discussed and imagined].</blockquote></center>





<p class="intro">Ultimately, to see this, there must be a shattering, a destruction of Dionysius and rebirth. 

But this Shattering-Rebirth Procession is Carnivalized: a one-fold, that is two-fold, that together is three-fold: in a carnival the audience are also the participants are also the judges of the quality of the entertainment.<BR><BR>

Thus to be Twice Born is to be Thrice Born: once as the mysterious Geno-type, once as the physical Pheno-type, and once as the source of wonderment at the structural unfinalizability of never being able to fully know how that Geno-type translates into a Pheno-type. </p>




<p class="intro">
<span style="font-size: 28px; ">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="intro">
<span style="font-size: 28px; ">From <B>Orpheus</b>, <i>Invocation 42</i> to Misa</span></p>

<blockquote>
<span class="large">I CALL Thesmophorus</span>, spermatic God,<BR>
Of various names, who bears the leafy rod:<BR>
Misa, ineffable, pure, sacred queen,<BR>
Two-fold Iacchus, male and female seen.<BR>
Illustrious, whether to rejoice is thine<BR>
In incense offer'd in the fane divine;<BR>
Or if in Phrygia most thy soul delights,<BR>
Performing with thy mother sacred rites;<BR>
Or if the land of Cyprus is thy care,<BR>
Pleas'd with the well crown'd Cytheria fair;<BR>
Or if exulting in the fertile plains<BR>
With thy dark mother Isis, where she reigns,<BR>
With nurses pure attended, near the flood<BR>
Of sacred Egypt, thy divine abode:<BR>
Wherever resident, benevolent attend,<BR>
And in perfection these our labours end.</blockquote>

<p>Notes:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Thesmophorus is the legislator.</li>
<li>It is well known that Iacchus is a mystic appellation of Bacchus, so that Misa is Bacchus.</li>
<li>Misa is also said to be both male and female, because this divinity comprehends in himself stable power and sameness, which are of a masculine
characteristic, and the measures of life and prolific powers, which are feminine peculiarities.</li>
<li>fane divine is the Temple of Ceres Eleusina</li></ul>

<p class="intro">Birth (of a human or of the universe) || Life (as human experience or universal presence) || Death (of life or of withdrawl of universal entropy). </p>

<p class="intro">Dionysius is the Kabbalistic shattering, providing the avenue for return to the source, with the source also being the end. The end is the beginning as a spiral - with new perspectives re-imagining that location based upon life's experience. The mystic appelation is used in both directions: pre-birth from the Pleroma, and post-death into the Pleroma. Thus we have three names: perhaps two, perhaps only one. But in any case, who I was is not who I am, nor will it be who I will be. And this despite, that there was something constant throughout: the stability of constancy and change. Life is a procession: a carnivalization of doing and being done to: just like the mysteries - both sides to this performance art are tethered to birth and to death, while birth and death are both the Pleroma as the mystic source of all. Thus the tethering while two-fold is one-fold, and as we have two together, we really have a three-fold: one-fold separately, two-fold separately, and one-fold and two-fold together as one, revealing one content with two appelations. </p>

<p class="intro">Dioynsius as Zagreus was ripped apart by the Titans and was born again as Bacchus, as Hades as Zeus. This connects the mystery of birth with the mystery of death, connected together through living. </p> 

<p class="intro">Fertility of food, of vegatable life, is as mysterious a process(ion) as the appearance of the universe of sentient life. Thus, the dirt is the Pleroma and the seed is the signal to assemble: from out of the Pleroma, there is also an assembling, a procession, outwards from the mysterious Elysian dirt unto its destiny as grown, and then unto its return into the Elsyian Fields, across the only horizon of the benben that humans can project themselves into, as the obelisk of time.  </p>

<p class="intro">Let us return to the fields where once I played, and remove the fortress, as such defenses are stifling upon entering the Elysian Fields with the master of life: Zagreus-Dionysius. </p>
</p>
<a name="chthonic"></a>
<p class="intro">Chthonic is a common term within these mystery sects. Its meaning certainly refers to guidance to and from the underworld, but also serves to denote a potential of any of the gods. Seemingly, a purpose of this term is to suggest a profound change of state, from life to death, from material to spiritual, from favor to disfavor, from water to land, from youth to old age, from ignorance to awakening. In this respect, a hiero-gamos - marriage to a divinity - is an invitation to fully embrace a new state of being, to cross a Rubicon and begin anew, to survive a deluge and emerge again into the always awaiting warm and inviting (and temporary) sunlight.</p>

The Dionysian Mysteries were a ritual of ancient Greece and Rome which sometimes used intoxicants, dance and music, and other trance-inducing techniques to remove inhibitions, social constraints, and earthly concerns, liberating the individual to return to a natural state. The Dionysian Mysteries, also in their Roman form named Bacchanalia, shifted <a href="#chthonic">chthonic</a> emphasis from underworld orientation to a transcendental, mystical one.</p>

<p class="places-list__place-text">Spirit possession involved liberation from civilization's rules and constraints, celebrating that which was outside civilized society and a return to primordial nature thus escaping from a socialized personality - the conditioned ego - into an ecstatic, deified state or into the collective consciousness of the primal herd. In this sense Dionysus was the beast-god within, the unconscious mind let loose as fertilizing, invigorating, cathartic, liberating and transformative.</p><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text">In Orphic religion, Dionysus was firstly son of Zeus and Persephone; and in reflecting a <a href="#chthonic">chthonic</a> or underworld aspect of Zeus=Hades, Dionysus then emerges as the twice-born son of Zeus and the mortal Semele. Depicted with a retinue of satyrs and dancers, Dionysus as Zagreus (the son of Zeus and Persephone) was dismembered by the Titans before being reborn, symbolizing the one who can guide the process of reincarnation. The alternate name Zagreus also describes him as a partner of Gaia, as the highest god or perhaps as Hades, as either Hades' son or Hades himself but noting that Hades' identity is likened to Zeus' alter ego, the <a href="#chthonic">chthonic</a> opportunity and destiny pre-existing in all actors within the fractious relations within the woven-web of experience. </p>

The Eleusinian Mysteries were initiations held every year for the cult of Demeter and Persephone based at Eleusis in ancient Greece, describing 
the abduction of Persephone from her mother Demeter by the king of the underworld Hades.  In a three-fold movement of descent (loss), the search (negotiation), and the ascent (reunion), we are led through the phases of coming to terms with the unfoldment of life: birth, aging, living against the horizon of death, embracing experience.</p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">The maiden (Kore) Persephone was assigned the painting all the flowers of the earth, when she was abducted and transported by
Hades to his underworld kingdom, having received approval from Persephone's father Zeus, King of the Gods. Distraught in her search, her mother Demeter coerced Zeus to allow the return of her daughter by causing a terrible drought in which the people suffered and starved, thus depriving the gods of sacrifice and worship. As a result, Zeus relented and allowed Persephone to return to her mother, with Hades first surreptitiously feeding Persephone pomegranate seeds, requiring her to return to Hades for half the year.  Persephone came to accept her marriage and role as Queen of the Underworld, and bringing the hope of springtime as the release from the death of winter and the realization of the cycle and interconnectedness of the fecundity of earth and the cycle of birth and death.</p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Iacchus, a morphing of Dionysius' being, rules over the glens of Demeter's Eleusis, leading the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire and whose attendant Thyiads dance in night-long frenzy. In the Eleusinian Mysteries Iacchus as the joy of living, as having opened a haven without toils, is represented as Demeter's husband, as Demeter's lover, as Demeter's suckling child: all three reflecting the gifts of being the mother of Persephone, husband of Hades, god of death and ruler of the underworld. </p>

Mythical poet Orpheus descended into the Hades' underworld and returned. Initiation into Orphic mysteries promised advantages in the afterlife.</p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Orpheus is the progenitor of the mythos of Dionysus. Wherein, Dionysus in his incarnation as Zagreus, is the son of Zeus and Persephone; Zeus gives his inheritance of the throne to the child, as Zeus is to leave due to Hera's anger over a child being born by another mother; the Titans are enraged over the proclamation of attendance and, at Hera's instigation, decide to murder the child. Dionysus is then tricked with a mirror and children's toys by the Titans, who murder and consume him. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Athena saves the heart and tells Zeus of the crime, who in turn hurls a thunderbolt on the Titans. The resulting soot, from which sinful mankind is born, contains the bodies of the Titans and Dionysus. The soul of man, the Dionysus part, is therefore divine, but the body, the Titan part, holds the soul in bondage. Thus, it was declared that the soul returns to a host ten times, bound to the wheel of rebirth.</p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">The two Orphic stories of the rebirth of Dionysus have the heart of Dionysus implanted into the thigh of Zeus and in the other Zeus has impregnated the mortal woman Semele, resulting in Dionysus's literal rebirth.</p><BR><BR><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Orphism distinguishes itself from Greek mythos in three ways: </p>
<ul><li>by characterizing human souls as divine and immortal but doomed to live in a "grievous circle" of successive bodily lives through
metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls</li> 
<li>by prescribing an ascetic way of life which, together with secret initiation
rites, was supposed to guarantee not only eventual release from the "grievous circle" but also communion with gods</li> 
<li>by being founded upon sacred writings about the origin of gods and human beings</li></ul>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Thracian Orpheus, son of Apollo and Calliope, in his fateful love for the beautiful Eurydice and after a short marriage Eurydice, dancing with Nymphs was bitten by a snake and died instantly. Orpheus descended to Hades by music to see his wife, appeasing Cerberus with music and presenting himself in front of Hades and his wife, Persephone. After playing music for Hades, Orpheus was told that he could take Eurydice back with him, but under one condition: she would have to follow behind him while walking out from the caves of the underworld, and he could not turn to look at her as they walked. Unable to hear Eurydice's footsteps, however, he began to fear that he had been fooled and losing faith turned to see Eurydice behind him, sending her back to be trapped in Hades' reign forever.</p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">
Orpheus, towards the end of his life, disdained the worship of all gods except Apollo. One early morning he went to the oracle of Dionysus at Mount Pangaion to salute his god at dawn, but was ripped to shreds by Thracian Maenads, Dionysus attendants, for not honoring his previous patron Dionysus and who likewise tired of Orpheus' mourning for his long-late wife Eurydice. Orpheus was buried in Pieria.</p>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">The Eleusinian Mysteries certainly changed shape over the centuries that it was practiced across the wide territory that this unconcealment  - <B>aletheia</b> [a-lethe, see below] - of the Mystery of Existence was holistically revealed. This change likely involved the addition of characters and rites and meanings and connections to the unfolding of life in that Greek uncovering. While the main stories of either Dionysius or Persephone may have remained central, other sub plots and ancilliary revelations may have either individually or collectively held more sway in the imagination of devotees, breathing as it were life into the chtholic journeys of personal understanding with share understanding and with the always misty hidden structural unfinalizability of Erebus. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">While in the current understandings of the clearing of aletheia involve modern technology and application of proven systems of reasoning and modern scientific process, this unconcealment also reveals structural unfinalizability in Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, in the Double Slit Experiment, in Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, in Hume's Problem of Induction: all of these are mysteries and our age struggles and changes to find "Holy Grails" of dark matter, or the Higg's Boson Field, or the "Field Beyond Field", the cause of the Big Bang. The ancient Greeks were searching for the pathways from life to death, from consciousness to pre-consciousness and to post-consciousness; all while living in a living world of agriculture, of weather, of oceans, of an authentic lived in world. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">What seems to be similar between these two eras is a force of "predictive programming", like a pre-echo of what is to come into consciousness from any experience. There for the awaiting devotees is a preparation for a holistic experience of what is to come. In the contemporary times in the early 21st century, we have given this burden and responsibility to artists to live on the edge, near the edge, sometimes beyond the edge to serve as chthlonic guides to peer into the misty future that is probabilistically to come and to relay some image to the rest of us. In former times, this was a personal burden and personal responsibility as wandering the pathways after death is always and only an individual and personal matter. While Hades serves as the Lord of the Underworld, where the very inevitability of physical death is the force that takes one to the Underworld, this is not the end of the journey.  </p><BR>


<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">This Underworld seems to be comprised of multiple locales including fields for those with unfulfilled dreams; the Asphodel Meadows, for the dead who wandered the realm for souls who were neither good nor evil in life and were forced to drink from the River Lethe in order to forget their lives; and the Elysian Fields for the blessed dead. Ensuring preparation with well-rehearsed Totenpass, allows a better chance at successful navigation of the immediate afterlife as one does not wish to unwarily confuse the Lake of Memory (Mnemosyne) {(allowing the dead to retain their memories and in my opinion allowing either directed informed reincarnation or to escape re-incarnation at least temporarily)} from the River of Forgetfulness (Lethe). To cite Orpheus:</p><BR><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">As today we hear of stories of long (hours and hours) after death "experiences", we quickly realize that the rivers of Hades need navigation and appeal to stories of Orpheus, of Dionysius, as well as of Jesus, are sought after in an age where life is authentically lived and not commoditized. We thus are wise to revisit, reconstruct, re-animate, re-assess the stories that have been understandably overwhelmed by the modern age. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">The journey of the Eleusinian Mysteries are a journey to meet Cronos on the islands of the blessed, the home of the favoured dead; or Macaria (Makaria) The goddess of blessed death or else the leader of the blessed dead; or Lampades Torch-bearing underworld nymphs in the train of the goddess Hecate. They may have guided the spirits of the blessed dead; or Rhadamanthys one of the three Judges of the Dead and King of the Elysian Fields, home of the favoured dead. There do seem to be those favorable to lead the dead to vantage that meets with their desires. Key is to make these desires clear to oneself first. Practicing these transcendent rites and having a well-rehearsed Totenpass may provide enough of an edge for most devotees. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">The year was 205 BCE amidst the end of the Second Punic War against Hannibal, reports of widespread ‘frequently falling rocks’ in the region with the repeated phenomenon creating religious fervour throughout the land. The meteorites had returned. Rome consulted the Sibylline Books for the eighth time in recorded history, and a general by the name of Scipio the Elder concluded that the Phrygian goddess Cybele - in the form of the aniconic stone of Phrygia - should be brought to Rome. It was. <BR><BR>
<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">In addition around this time, Saturnalia underwent a major reform in 217 BC, after the Battle of Lake Trasimene, when the Romans suffered one of their most crushing defeats by Carthage during the Second Punic War. Until that time, they had celebrated the holiday according to Roman custom. It was after a consultation of the Sibylline Books that they adopted "Greek rite", introducing sacrifices carried out in the Greek manner, the public banquet, and the continual shouts of io Saturnalia that became characteristic of the celebration. Cato the Elder (234–149 BC) remembered a time before the so-called "Greek" elements had been added to the Roman Saturnalia.<BR><BR>
Cybele's Phrygian cult had previously been adopted and adapted by Greek colonists of Asia Minor and spread to mainland Greece and its more distant western colonies around the 6th century BCE. In Rome, Cybele became known as Magna Mater ("Great Mother"). As a key celestial stabilizing factor, the Roman state adopted and developed a particular form of her cult after the Sibylline Oracle recommended her conscription, by bringing to Rome her Baetylus, that sacred "stone" endowed with living access to the deity. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">In Rome, the Megalesia festival to Magna Mater commenced on April 4 and on April 10, her image was taken in public procession to the Circus Maximus where chariot races were held in her honour. A statue of Magna Mater was permanently sited on the racetrack's dividing barrier, showing the goddess seated on a lion's back. Greek Dionysius of Halicarnassus describes this procession as wild Phrygian "mummery" and "fabulous clap-trap", in contrast to the Megalesian sacrifices and games, carried out in what he admires as a dignified "traditional Roman" manner. Dionysius applauds the wisdom of Roman religious law, which soon forbade the participation of any Roman citizen in the procession and in the goddess's mysteries while slaves were forbidden to witness any of the procession's armed "war dancers" in their three-plumed helmets, clashing their shields together, bronze on bronze, "delighted by blood"; yellow-robed, long-haired, perfumed Galli-castrati waving their knives, wild music of thrumming tympanons and shrill flutes and along the route, with rose petals scattered and clouds of incense arising around the goddess's image adorned by the Mural Crown and seated within a sculpted, lion-drawn chariot carried high on a bier. The Roman display of Cybele's Megalesia procession was an exotic, privileged public pageant, a stark contrast to what is known of the private, socially inclusive Phrygian-Greek mysteries on which it was based.</p><BR><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text"><B>'Holy week' in March:</B></p>
<ul><li>March 15 (Ides): Canna intrat ("The Reed enters"), marking the birth of Attis and his exposure in the reeds along the Phrygian river Sangarius. </li>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Cybele's consort (Attis) and her eunuch Phrygian priests (Galli) would have arrived with the goddess, along with at least some of the wild, ecstatic features of her Greek and Phrygian cults. Imperial Magna Mater protected the Roman Empire's cities and agriculture — Ovid "stresses the barrenness of the earth before the Mother's arrival". Virgil's Aeneid, written between 29 and 19 BC, embellishes her "Trojan" features; she is Berecyntian Cybele, mother of Jupiter himself, and protector of the Trojan prince Aeneas in his flight from the destruction of Troy.</p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Rome's strictures against castration and citizen participation in Magna Mater's cult limited both the number and kind of her initiates. From the 160's AD, citizens who sought initiation to her mysteries could offer either of two forms of bloody animal sacrifice – and sometimes both – as lawful substitutes for self-castration. The Taurobolium sacrificed a bull, the most potent and costly victim in Roman religion; the Criobolium used a lesser victim, usually a ram. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Myths of the deified Attis present him as founder of Cybele's Galli priesthood.  He was both Agdistis' lover and Agdistis' offspring, representing the masculine aspect of Agdistis that had been taken away.</p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text"><i>300 BCE to 400 CE</i> The correspondences and distinctions between Agdistis and Cybele are unclear - sometimes as the same entity, sometimes as different entities. Although an Phrygian deity, Agdistis had a cult spanning from Egypt to Crimea.  According to Pausanias, Zeus unknowingly fathered Agdistis, a superhuman being who was both man and woman, with Gaia. Other myths concern other gods' fear of the androgynous Agdistis with Dionysus putting a sleeping potion in Agdistis' drinking well and after Agdistis had fallen asleep, Dionysus tied Agdistis' foot to Agdistis' penis with a rope. When Agdistis awoke and stood up, the penis ripped off with the blood falling and growing into an almond tree from which Nana, daughter of a river-god Sangarius, was gathering fruit and stored some in her bosom, where they disappeared and made her pregnant with Attis. As an adult, Attis was of such extraordinary beauty that the now conventionally female Agdistis fell in love with him, despite being his blood father. However, Attis' foster parents intended him to become the husband of the daughter of the king of Pessinus, and Attis accordingly went to the Pessinian royal court. When the marriage song commenced, Agdistis appeared in full glory, and all the wedding guests were instantly driven mad, causing both Attis and the king of Pessinus to castrate themselves and the bride to cut off her breasts. Agdistis then repented her deed and obtained from Zeus the promise that the body of Attis would not decompose.</p><BR>

Khoiak (mid-September-mid-October) was the Egyptian month for the ritual associated with Osiris, replaying the struggle between Osiris and his brother Seth, Osiris' death, an his resurrection with the intervention of his wife Isis. The end of this festival coincided with the time of planting. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Playing out brotherly jealousy, King Osiris was drowned and his then dismembered body scattered in sixteen locations around Egypt. Isis collected the pieces and was able to reanimate Osiris to conceive their child Horus, allowing Osiris to then proceed to the next world and rule over the dead. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">An interesting quote comes down from Athanasius Kircher, early 1600s, where he used a holistic interpretative method using the Bembine Tablet of Isis and not the latter discovered Rosetta Stone to place a meaning on ḏd Wsr, now decoded as "Osiris says". Kircher rather placed the meaning of "The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis; the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis". What we see, perhaps accidentally, is that the very force of destruction Typhon played out in Set, Osiris' jealous brother, cannot overcome the power of Isis to revive life, to give life, to prevent darkness from having sway in this world. The only way that Osiris may speak is after Isis returns Osiris from the dead. That Osiris can speak means that the treachery of Typhon indeed ends at the throne of Isis. </p>

The Pantheon of the Great Gods at the Samothrace Complex consists of numerous <a href="#chthonic">chthonic</a> deities, primarily predating the arrival of Greek colonists on the
island in the 7th century BCE, and congregating around one central figure – the Great Mother. The identity and nature of the deities venerated at the sanctuary remains largely enigmatic, in large part because it was taboo to
pronounce their names, despite this Cult being well-documented at the time and having a very open initiation. The cult does not fit easily into the Olympic pantheon.The head priestess, and often a prophetess, was titled a Sybil (Cybele - mother goddess of the Phrygians).</p><BR>

The Cabeiri were a group of enigmatic <a href="#chthonic">chthonic</a> deities, worshiped in a localized mystery cult closely associated with Hephaestus and centered in the north Aegean islands of Lemnos. The cult
does not fit easily into the Olympic pantheon. Detailing of the number of Cabeiri varies from four as a pair of males and a pair of females, to even more, to a tribe or whole race of
Cabeiri, often presented as all male. The most common were two people: an old man, Axiocersus, and his son, Cadmilus.</p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">
The name of the Cabeiri recalls Mount Kabeiros, a mountain in the region of Berekyntia in Asia Minor, closely associated with
the Phrygian Mother Goddess. The name Kadmilus, or Kasmilos, one of the Cabeiri usually depicted as a young boy, was linked even in antiquity to Camillus, an old Latin word for a boy-attendant in a cult, likely a loan from the
Etruscan language, which may be related to Lemnian.</p>

The minister of Persephone, Hecate was the goddess of witchcraft, necromancy, ghosts and crossroads. She had few temples in the ancient world but small household shrines erected to ward off evil and the malevolent powers of witchcraft were quite common. Her most important cult centres were those of Eleusis and the island of Samothrace where she was worshipped as an associate-goddess of the Mysteries. The household shrines served as a location to make offerings of two kinds:  one that was consumed by the worshippers in the ritual, an ouranic-sacrifice, where the food was blessed by the Gods and a small amount was given to them as their part, often burned in the fire, with the worshippers then eating remainder.The second type was of making the total an offering to the Gods, <a href="#chthonic">chthonic</a>-sacrifices. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Often those offerings were apotropaic, for the averting of evil, or were for the cleansing from miasma or as an offering to underworldly Gods and Dæmnons. Ancient Athenians held that once a lunar month, Hekate led the spirits of the unavenged or wrongfully killed accompanied by hounds from the underworld up from Hades. This event was experienced during the monthly dark moon, of the last visible crescent of a waning Moon, at the Deipnon (Dark Moon) and was celebrated with the Deipnon Meal welcoming in the Noumenia, when the first sliver of moon became visible. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">To offer things to the Gods is strongly connected to the principle of giving and taking, a gentle form of hierogamos - a marriage with the divine. Making such a connection with the Gods opens their blessings, recognizing that all that you have in your life comes one way or another from the Gods. Offerings are a method to give a small amount of those blessings back to its origin in an clear gesture of gratitude and respect. The participant will then be more open to notice through this practice of offering that the Gods have brought blessings in their life. On a religious level, the offerings nourish the Gods and Dæmnons, who imbibe the essence of the offerings helping them to manifest themselves more powerfully in the life of the devotees. In short, offerings build bridges between the worlds, creating a permanent <a href="#chthonic">chthonic</a> pathway for the devotees, Gods and Dæmnons to remain closer together.</p><BR>
<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Hecate issued forth from the underworld with a train of torch-bearing Lampades, demonic Lamiae, ghosts and hell-hounds. 
Following in the train of Hecate, the Lampades were torch-bearing underworld nymphs guiding the spirits of the blessed dead, as hopeful initiates of the Eleusinian Mysteries, to their final resting place in Elysium. The Lamiae also in the train of Hecate, however, were underworld dæmones that were vampiric monsters who assumed the forms of beautiful women to seduce and devour young men.</p>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Sabazios is the horseman and sky father god of the Phrygians and Thracians. In
Indo-European languages, such as Phrygian, the -zios element in his name derives from dyeus, the common precursor of Latin deus ('god') and Greek Zeus. Though the Greeks interpreted Phrygian Sabazios as both Zeus and Dionysus,
representations of him, even into Roman times, show him always on horseback, as a nomadic horseman god, wielding his characteristic staff of power. Sabazios' conflicts with the Phrygian Mother Goddess Cybele, whose creature was the Lunar Bull, may be seen in the way that Sabazios' horse places a hoof on the head of a bull.</p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Sabazios is the same as Dionysos. Clement of Alexandria had been informed that the secret mysteries of Sabazius, as practiced among the Romans, involved a serpent, a
<a href="#chthonic">chthonic</a> creature unconnected with the mounted skygod of Phrygia. It is conjectured that the Romans identified the Jewish YHVH Tzevaot ("sa-ba-oth", "of the Hosts") as Jove Sabazius. There is also a likely connection with the myth of St. George. Marduk associations seem clear with the serpent/dragon/Tiamat. </p>

In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, Triptolemus is mentioned as one of the original priests of Demeter, one of the first men to learn the secret rites and mysteries of Eleusinian Mysteries along with Diocles, Eumolpos, Celeus and Polyxeinus. Triptolemus had a cult of his own, apart from the Mysteries, where one entered his temple on the way to the closed-off sacred precinct, before coming to the former Hekataion, the temple of Artemis outside the great Propylaia.
</p><BR><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Demeter chose to teach Triptolemus the art of agriculture and, from him, the rest of Greece learned to plant and reap crops. He flew across the land on a chariot drawn by dragons while Demeter and Persephone, once restored to her mother, cared for him, and helped him complete his mission of educating the whole of Greece in the art of agriculture. Triptolemus was equally associated with the bestowal of hope for the afterlife as associated with the Eleusinian Mysteries.</p>

Life on earth is merely a transition to a higher life and Mithras-worship became one, and perhaps the most significant, of the religions of redemption. Mithraism emerged at the same time as Elagabalus arose in Homs, Syria, and Glycon in Abonoteichos, Paphlagonia, northern Turkey, and Jupiter Dolichenus in Doliche.</p><BR><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">The birth of Mithras from the rock, therefore, would appear to represent the idea that he is in some sense greater than the cosmos. Capable of moving the entire universe, he cannot be contained within the cosmic sphere, and is therefore depicted in the rock-birth as bursting out of the enclosing cave of the universe, and establishing his presence in the transcendent space beyond the cosmos, the snake that entwines Mithras evokes unmistakeably the famous Orphic myth of the snake-entwined "cosmic egg". One is also immediately reminded of Abraxas. </p><BR><BR>


<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Plutarch says that in 67 B.C. a large band of pirates based in Cilicia (a province on the southeastern coast of Asia Minor) were practicing strange secret rites of "Mithras"; however, Plutarch also uses Mithras to describe a god of Darius in Plutarch's chapter discussing the Alexander campaign. Thus it is not clear that, to Plutarch, Mithras was not a generalized name for any mysterious god of heathens of the east, including of any strange practices of Cilician pirates.</p><BR><BR>


<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Plato in his dialogue Timaeus said that when the creator of the universe first formed the cosmos, he shaped its substance in the form of the letter X. David Ulansey concorded the Taurus, Scorpion and other symbols of the Mithran Rites as representative of the crossing paths of the equinox and a movement from the Age of Taurus to the Age of Aries. This passage makes a cross, as in the image of the Mithran Lion, an Abraxas figure. We see in the confusion of this period of time a celestial change from the <i>Age of Taurus</i>(and opposite Scorpio) to the <i>Age of Aries</i> as well as in an "object" of great significance unsettling the fabric of stability, creating great opportunity for one Syrian family, and plunging the Roman Empire into disarray for over 100 years until Constantine re-established metaphysical stability by instituting Christianity as the singular Roman Religion in 313 CE.

Elagabalus was initially venerated only at Emesa in Syria (now Homs), beginning around the year 160 CE. The cult statue was then brought to Rome by the 14 year old Emperor Heliogabalus (Elagabalus) - Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, who, before his accession, was the "hereditary" "high priest" at the Emesa temple. This Syrian deity was later assimilated with the Roman sun god known as Sol Invictus, the Invincible Sun. </p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">This standard story does not reveal that it was just the great grandfather of Emperor Heliogabalus who discovered the "object" and then started the cult, building a massive temple in Homs. Thus, this was not a "Syrian Deity" but a sudden emergence which catapulted an unknown family to great prominence in Emesa. The "hereditary" is likely he was the second person to look after the "object".</p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Speculation that the "object" was a meteor is incoherent as the remains were perhaps 10 feet, by 8 feet by 8 feet, and such a meteorite would have left a massive crater, and no crater is to be found either near Homs nor near a possible initial sites nearby Doliche, Turkey, at 160 miles away, and also sites of the contemporaneous and also suddenly arising Jupiter Dolichenus cult, Mithras cult, and Glycon cult. Such a coincidental sudden appearance in one general location at the same time of four cults, along with the massive destabilization of the Roman empire, gives rise to an event of singular interest and importance.</p><BR>

<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">At the start of this event, Emporer Commodus lost his senses and became a raving meglomaniac, throwing the previous stable emporership into complete turmoil, leading to the Year of 5 Emporers and then leading to the family of the "Elagabalus Cult" taking over for 42 years, after which the Roman Empire fell into disarray for just over 100 years, known as the 3<sup>rd</sup> Century Crisis. </p><BR>
<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Whatever was the basis for this "cult" it: 1) had no history, 2) harnessed great political power, 3) resulted in great destruction, 4) provided great inspirational power, 5) had no analogue in Roman or other history. </p>

Glycon, earlier mentioned by Horace in 20 CE, was the centerpoint of a short-lived cult in 2<sup>nd</sup> century Roman Empire and was described by contemporary Lucian as created by Greek prophet Alexander of Abonoteichos.  A large tame snake with human head wound round Alexander's body as he sat in a shrine in the temple gaving or oracles. The center of this cult was in Abonoteichos, Paphlagonia, northern Turkey. There are coins of the emperors Lucius Verus and Marcus Aurelius and of a statue of Alexander, said by Athenagoras to have stood in the forum of Parium.</p><BR><BR>
<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">Partly drawing on the story of Olympias's impregnation by Zeus disguised as a serpent, the snake appeared after Alexander had foretold the coming of a new incarnation of Asclepius, son of Apollo and Coronis.

The Johannites centered their cult in Basrah and Susa, Mesopotamia. This group is referred to under a larger title of Sabians, a very ancient sect named after Sabi son of Enoch. 
The Sabians held that the planets were the residences of the mediating spirits, and the Johannites viewed Jesus as one of the seven planets, Mercury (Hermes), and that he was baptized in Jordan by John. In this, we may also assert that Johannites may have been a cult that grew out of and perhaps supplanted in terms of imagination and iconography the much older Mandeans.</p><BR>  
<p class="places-list__place-text js-places-list-place-text">
Yet placing John the Baptist at the forefront during the era of Christ and having a center far from the Sabian centers at Harran and "Ur of the Chaldees" provides an insight into why perhaps the Knights Templar, under the name Christians of St John, may have embraced this cult and elevated John to a recent incarnation of much older pre-Sabian times, with John being represented as an incarnated aeon, thus hearkening back indeed to the times of Enoch. </p>

The syncretic Serapis arose from identity of Egyptian Osiris and Apis and Greek Hades and Demeter. However, the name Serapis derived from appeal to Mesopotamian god Enki (Ea), as Šar Apsi, "King of the Apsu", mentioned at the death of Alexander in 325 BCE. In an effort to unite the Egyptian religion with the Greek forms of the new kings, the cult was created by the Greek ruler Ptolemy I and was based in the Serapeum in Alexandria, despite likely having some small syncretism someone as inspiration for Ptolemy I.
