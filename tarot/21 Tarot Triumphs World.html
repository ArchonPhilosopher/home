<b><span style="font-size: large;">The World&nbsp;</span></b><br>
<br>
<b><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;The early cards</span></span></b><br>
<br>
An anomaly about the World card is that in the early lists from Lombardy
 and the Ferrara region it is the highest triumph (trump), while in 
Florence and Bologna it is the second to the highest. Such reversals 
between adjacent cards is not uncommon between regions and even within 
one region, but in this case the meaning of the card may be affected, if
 the other is the Last Judgment, and that card signals precisely the end
 of this world and its replacement by the New Jerusalem. In that case 
the World card might refer to a world beyond the world of our current 
experience. On the other hand, if the Angel comes last, that might be 
interpreted as the New Jerusalem. <br>
<br>
Some evidence that early on the Lombard cards was next to last is found 
in an account by Francesco Piscina, writing in nearby Piedmont in 1565. 
He has the card with a trumpeting angel last. He writes (trans. 
Caldwell, Depaulis and Ponzi, <i>Explaining the Tarot</i>, 2010, p. 25):
<br>
<blockquote>
...the inventor...placed as last the image of Celestial Paradise, where 
blessed souls triumph. There he depicted an Angel that, singing and 
playing, rejoices in those that were made worthy of that most happy 
eternal rest firstly by the grace of God and by their own good deeds. 
... </blockquote>
This card is clearly that of the Judgment, even though he interprets it as after the judgment, in Paradise.
<br>
<blockquote>
He considers that it is necessary to act well.in order to gain the glory
 of Paradise, as taught by the Holy Evangelists. So, before the image of
 Paradise, he made a portrait of these four Evengelists, intended and 
signified by the four symbols, Angel, Ox, Eagle, and Lion... </blockquote>
That card of course is what we call the World, by 1565 having the four creatures in the corners of the card.<br>
<br>
This tradition is confirmed in Piedmont practice even after the 
French-inspired cards that players used had the number 21 written on 
them: they still treated the card as 20th in actual play. &nbsp; <br>
<br>



<img border="0" data-original-height="1178" data-original-width="1165" height="400" src="./historyoftarotfiles/Visconti&amp;Sforza.jpg" width="395">
<br>
However we do not have to imagine the card with the Angel as Paradise in
 order to put the World card before it. The Visconti card of c. 1442 has
 a lady on top holding a long winged trumpet in one hand and a crown in 
the other. The trumpet is an attribute of Fame, by which one's deeds are
 trumpeted around the world, aided by the trumpet's wings. The crown 
suggests a possible reward for famous deeds, namely rulership of some 
sort, symbolic or otherwise. Below her a mounted knight stands beside a 
lake, in a scene reminiscent of a topographical map where towns are 
indicated by castles.<br>
<br>
It has been speculated that this scene relates to an episode in the life
 of Francesco Sforza, in which this mercenary captain rescued the forces
 of another Visconti captain in which that captain escaped capture only 
by being hidden in a boat crossing a river.That the knight is Sforza is 
also suggested by other cards in the deck, notably the court cards in 
Batons and Swords, which contain Sforza heraldics,and the male on the 
Love and Chariot cards.Here we might recall that in Petrarch's <i>I Trionfi</i>,
 Love and Chastity were among the subjects, as were Fame and Eternity. 
The lady and the scene suggest Fame. The scene also has a mythic 
quality, in that the fisherman on the bank of the lake suggests the 
Fisher King of the Grail legend, and the knight Sir Parsifal, who alone 
among Arthur's knights was able to find the Grail Castle and thus win 
glory from that result.<br>
\<br>
These are all events before the Last Judgment. In contrast, the 
Sforza-era card features a city on an island surrounded by water, all 
above two cherubs below, who point to it. It is some sort of ideal or 
future existence, perhaps that of a future city in this world, but more 
likely the Heavenly Jerusalem of the Apocalypse. It could also be both, 
as though the future Milan would be a version of the ideal world to 
come. In fact the architect&nbsp; Filarete had proposed of such a city in his
 Sforzinda, a city of that name, below right (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sforzinda">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sforzinda</a>).<br>


<img border="0" data-original-height="701" data-original-width="1600" height="280" src="./historyoftarotfiles/21azodiacSforzaSforzinda.jpg" width="640">
 In that sense it could also be the Grail Castle, as an ideal city, now 
put beyond this World. Stuart Kaplan in his Encyclopedia of Tarot shows 
an example, a similar island surrounded by water.<br>
<br>
There is thus the possibility that the Visconti card was next to last in
 the sequence, the Sforza card, done 20 to 40 years later, reflects a 
later Lombard convention where it was the last card, in conformity with 
its position in the Ferrara region. There a list of triumphs sometime 
after around 1460 referred to the card as "El Mondo, cioe Dio, il Papa",
 "The world, that is, God the Father." From the extant Ferrarese cards 
it is hard to tell whether it is this world or the next that is meant. 
My best guess is that the printed card suggests that our world is in the
 hands of Divine Providence. Given that the cherub on the Este card 
suggests Cupid, that figure might represent God's love for the world. In
 that case the scene would be this world but from a divine perspective, 
allowing also for its transformation after the Last Judgment.<br>

<br>
A Parisian card from the early 17th century seems to suggest again 
Divine Providence, personified as a woman holding a sail to direct the 
world, which was often represented as a circle divided into three and 
surmounted by a cross (which here is more like the bejeweled hilt of a 
sword).<br>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
</div>

In the early Florentine cards (above left, one now in Catania, Sicily, 
the other in the "Charles VI", now in Paris), as in the Visconti 
version, there is a lady on the top holding accoutrements of fame in her
 hands, a scepter and a globe, above a circle with castles and hills. In
 Bologna (center right above) it is Mercury, the mediator between gods 
and humans, and the circle contains symbols of the four elements. In 
Minchiate, the lady has an arrow (a misreading of the trumpet?) and a 
crown, and the four winds are added to the globe below her. These winds 
are frequently found in the corners of maps at that time.


<img border="0" data-original-height="816" data-original-width="1600" height="326" src="./historyoftarotfiles/21primaHeilegeRomanesque.jpg" width="640">

Although not a tarot card, the highest card of the "Tarot of Mantegna" (above 
left) features a cosmograph, i.e. a map of the entire cosmos, seen as a 
series of concentric circles. The label says "Prima Causa", First Cause,
 i.e. God in Aristotelian language, who was the cause of it all. The 
first version of that card had just the cosmograph. In the second 
version, probably still in the 15th century, the four creatures were 
added in the corners. They were the four beasts of the Apocalypse, but 
also symbolic of the four evangelists and perhaps the four elements. 
Whether they also represented four zodiacal signs is unclear, because 
the eagle was not associated with Scorpio in this early period, at least
 as documented. And while the bull would be associated with earth and 
the lion with fire, the associations to the other two are not clear. The
 evangelists themselves were associated with the four elements in 
various ways.<br>
<br>
An interesting description of the card is provided by Francesco Piscina,
 writing from Piedmont in 1565. I have already mentioned the four 
evangelists in the corners of the card (p 25).
<br>
<blockquote>
Now the author has placed the image of the world in the middle of these 
four Holy Evangelists, in order to teach us that the world cannot be 
without religion, whose precept has been written by these Holy 
Evangelists.</blockquote>
We may wonder just what the World card before him looked like. Reading 
"world" as "cosmos", it would seem to be something like the "Mantegna" 
image just shown above right.

<img border="0" data-original-height="921" data-original-width="1317" height="446" src="./historyoftarotfiles/pic_2019-05-31_092637-page-001a.jpg" width="640"><br>
&nbsp;In the Middle Ages a city was sometimes represented as a series of 
concentric rings. Cities were in fact constructed with such defensive 
rings, but the implication is that the hand of providence has shaped the
 city as much as it has the cosmos. An example is a c. 1366 fresco on 
the ceiling of the former guildhall of Judges and Notaries in Florence. 
It is meant to be Florence, with its walls, gates, four quarters, 
sixteen districts, and twenty-one guilds, but also with intimations of 
the cosmos and the Heavenly Jerusalem. The city is surrounded by the 
four cardinal virtues in each corner, while on either side between 
virtues are civil and canon law.&nbsp; 


<img border="0" data-original-height="714" data-original-width="1600" height="284" src="./historyoftarotfiles/10vmNoblet.jpg" width="640"></a>
At some point in the 16th century, either in Lombardy or France, a human
 figure in a mandorla replaced the globe in the middle of the card 
(above left). The figure seems almost deliberately androgynous, and 
later cards took it both ways, sometimes as male (Vieville, c. 1650 
Paris), sometimes as female (Dodal 1708 Lyon), and sometimes as a male 
with breasts (Noblet c. 1660 Paris).&nbsp; The standard Marseille pattern had
 it as clearly female (Chosson, c. 1734m below left, Conver 1761 but 
printed c. 1860, center), although one late version gave it a masculine 
face (at right). This version was popularized by Paul Marteau starting 
around 1930 as the "ancient tarot of Marseille," although that 
particular face is no earlier than the late 19th century.

<img border="0" data-original-height="761" data-original-width="1600" height="304" src="./historyoftarotfiles/UraniaPhanesAion.jpg" width="640"><br>
One inspiration might have been Durer's woodcut of Urania, muse of 
astronomy but also goddess of divine love, Aphrodite Urania now as the 
soul of the cosmos. "Mondo" in Italian is ambiguous in Italian between 
"universe" - meaning all the concentric circles of the medieval cosmos -
 and "the earth", which would be just the last one, earth surrounded by 
air and supporting water.<br>
<br>
For the figure in the center of an ellipse holding two sticks, another 
influence could be a Roman-era Orphic medallion of bisexual Phanes, 
Greek for light-bearer, the child of Time and Necessity in Orphic 
mythology, who wind themselves around him in the cosmic egg (<a href="https://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Phanes.html">https://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Phanes.html</a>).
 There is also the lion-headed god Aion of Mithraism, of which some 
examples were known in Italy and France..The serpent then becomes the 
sash draped over the figure on the card. He is the cosmocrater, whose 
body divides into Heaven and Earth and then, at his hand, into all 
things. In the Wisdom literature of the Hebrew Bible, it is Wisdom, 
Sophia of its Greek translation, who makes all things well. In 
Christianity he corresponds to the Logos, by whom "all things were 
made", according to the Gospel of John. The figure's nudity merely 
accentuates its divine status, a property frequently given to gods as 
opposed to humans, as for example in Titian's famous painting, sometimes
 called <i>Sacred and Profane Love</i>, in which the human of the pairm allegedly the bride of the commissioner, is fully clothed.

<br>
<b>De Gebelin, Etteilla, and the Occultists</b>
<br>
<br>
In 1781 Antoine Court de Gebelin introduced the fashion of writing about
 hidden meanings in the cards, in his case showing to his satisfaction 
that the cards came from ancient Egypt. The four creatures now have an 
Egyptian interpretation, representing the four seasons of the year. He 
did not consider that Egypt, being so far south, might not have four 
seasons (in fact it has only three), or that the seasons might not have 
the same activities there as in his country. The birds return in the 
spring, hence the eagle. (Eagles were never used in Egyptian art, nor 
did birds return in the spring, although some may have come for the 
winter.) The summer is fiery hot (true enough), hence the Lion. The ox 
is for autumn plowing (fair enough, since it was after the annual 
flood). Winter was for gathering in society (actually there was 
harvesting and more planting to do; the big festivals were at the end of
 June, the beginning of the new year).<br>
<br>
For the figure in the middle, he imposed his reading of the Orphic myth 
onto the card, even if Orphism is not Egyptian. She was the goddess of 
Time, and "goes around like Time, in a circle that represents the 
revolutions of time, thus the egg into which all is released into Time."
 He must have seen a drawing of the Orphic medallion. His recognition of
 the zodiac as an egg is not bad; and the figure is at least enclosed in
 Time and born of, if not into, Time, Kronos as Chronos, an ancient 
assimilation.<br>
<br>
Gebelin's collaborator the Comte de Mellet repeated Gebelin's analysis, 
adding only that the goddess in the middle was Isis. Had he read 
Macrobius's Saturnalia, he might have repeated the latter's assertion 
that Isis is the world-soul. However an interpretation of her as Isis 
does not require much erudition. Indeed Isis, as can be seen in papyrus 
illustrations, stood behind the throne of judgment to welcome the 
virtuous into the afterlife. <br>

<img border="0" data-original-height="1388" data-original-width="774" height="400" src="./historyoftarotfiles/Grand&#39;Etteilla 001a.jpg" width="222">

Etteilla said of this card in his 2nd Cahier:<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp;No. 5. The fifth sheet bears the number 6 for its day of creation: <i>God made Man in his image</i>, being then, in regard to human physicality, in perfection; it bears for its Element the number 4, “Earth.”</blockquote>
Accordingly both numbers are on the card. The card has the usual woman 
and creatures, but with the addition of pyramids in the oval, apparently
 to show the card's authenticity. They are in the Greek style, much 
higher than they are wide. Etteilla must not have known what the famous 
pyramids of Egypt looked like.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The upright keyword is "Voyage", which must have been suggested by the 
word "World", which Etteilla in the 3rd Cahier retains as the title for 
the card. The association perhaps goes back as far as the type of card 
that showed hills and towns, like a map. But how does "World" relate to 
the 6th day of creation, given that the world was already created before
 then. I think the answer might be in what he says about the number 2 in
 the <i>1st Cahier</i>, namely:<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The Creator formed Adam, male &amp; female; and separated this number
so that he could extend to the number 3, generation. After the number 3
comes necessarily 4, the universe, which we also find in the
microcosmic number 2</blockquote>
In other words, in creating Adam and Eve, the creator has created a world in miniature, called the microcosm in Hermetic lore.<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">


<img border="0" data-original-height="1250" data-original-width="1600" height="312" src="./historyoftarotfiles/Levi2.v1.jpg" width="400"></div>
<br>
This interpretation is echoed by Eliphas Levi in what he says about the 
card. Giving it the number Tau, the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, 
he says (<i>Doctrine and Ritual of High Magic</i>, Greer and Mikituk trans., p. 400):<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The microcosm; the summary of everything in everything.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hieroglyph. Kether, or the Cabalistic:crown, between four mysterious 
animals; in the middle of the crown, we see Truth holding a magic wand 
in each hand.</blockquote>
The human figure is the microcosm of everything else, just as Kether 
contains everything else in the sefiroth within itself, as its source. 
In his drawing of the card, in a later work, the crown was replaced by a
 series of 12 circles with a cross inside them n and just showed the 
woman, at last unveiled for our gratification.<br>
<br>
In another part of his book, Chapter 22 of Book I, he says of the card (p. 185):<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp;This universal arcanum, the final and eternal secret of high 
initiation, is symbolized in the Tarot by a naked young girl who touches
 the earth with onl one foot and holds a magnetized&nbsp; wand in each hand, 
and seems to be running in a crown held up by an angel, an eagle, a bull
 and a lion. The figure is basically analogous to the cherub of 
Yehesqiel [Jekeskiel in original], whose drawing we provide, as the 
Indian symbol of Ardhanari [Addhanari in original], analogue of the 
Ado-nai of Yehesqiel, who is vulgarly called Ezekiel.</blockquote>

<br>
Greer and Mikituk provide no drawing here, but in the origina (online in
 Gallica), between pp. 366 and 367, there appears a Hindu-like drawing, 
where three animals can be identified (an ox, a tiger, and a lion or 
bear on the dress) as well as objects resembling the four suit-objects. A
 similar drawing is in Kaplan's <i>Encyclopedia of Tarot</i>, vol. 1, p.
 19 (1978), with a couple of differences. Most importantly, the breast 
on the right side is less pronounced, suggesting androgyny; Kaplan 
describes it s a union of Shiva with his "wife of many names" (p. 18). 
Another difference is that the objects are not quite the same: the 
"scepter" might be a trident, and the "cup" is probably a drum. These 
differences do not seem to be important: it is only the resemblance that
 matters. <br>

Levi's follower Paul Christian and those who created cards from his 
writings took the crown but could not fit the woman inside it. Christian
 does not mention it, For him it is a garland of golden roses inside of 
which is a star and on which are the heads of an ox, lion, eagle, and 
man. It is the only one of the 22 that he actually provided a drawing 
for. At this stage the initiate has attained a power limited only by his
 own intelligence and wisdom (trans. pp. 110-112).<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Remember, son of earth, the empire of the World belongs to the empire of
 Light, which is the throne reserved by God for sanctified Will. 
Happiness for the Magus is the fruit of the knowledge of Good and Evil; 
but God only allows it to be plucked by the man sufficiently master of 
himself to approach it without covetousness.&nbsp; </blockquote>
The "Recompense" that is the key word is made clear in his summary (trans. p. 112):<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
All will that unites itself to God in order to demonstrate Truth and 
operate Justice enters, after this life, into participation with the 
divine Omnipotence over beings and things, the Eternal Reward [XXI] of 
enfranchised spirits. </blockquote>
Billaudaut, in the 1860s, decided upon a literal crown, with no room for
 the young woman Truth, but with Christian's title "Recompense".&nbsp; By the
 time of Falconnier, 1895, real images of Egyptian women were available.
 So she could be portrayed playing an Egyptian stringed instrument, with
 roses even if the four creatures above her seem Egyptianate fantasy. 
Instead of the woman there is a kind of flying torpedo: I do not 
recognize the symbol.&nbsp; The colored version, with golden roses, is from 
the Brotherhood of Light, founded by C. C. Zain, with a somewhat more 
fanciful instrument. The Brotherhood's Hebrew letter departs from Levi 
so as to give the last letter to the Fool.<br>

<br>
For Papus in <i>Tarot of the Bohemians</i> the card has meaning on three
 levels. First is the Absolute, which is to say God, whose name is 
spelled out by the four animals, each standing for a different letter of
 YHVH. They also relate to the four suits, in the order Scepters, Cups, 
Coins, Swords, and the four elements, in the order fire, water, earth, 
air. Second is Nature, the Universe, which is also the body of the 
Absolute. Third is the soul of the Absolute, that is, humanity in the 
form of Adam-Eve, represented by the figure inside the ellipse.<br>
<br>


<img border="0" data-original-height="1436" data-original-width="804" height="400" src="./historyoftarotfiles/waite1.jpg" width="223">A.E. Waite says of this card:<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
It represents also the perfection and end of the Cosmos, the secret 
which is within it, the rapture of the universe when it understands 
itself in God. It is further the state of the soul in the consciousness 
of Divine Vision, reflected from the self-knowing spirit. ... </blockquote>
Amplifying on "perfection and end of the Cosmos" he adds:<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
It has more than one message on the macrocosmic side and is, for 
example, the state of the restored world when the law of manifestation 
shall have been carried to the highest degree of natural perfection. But
 it is perhaps more especially a story of the past, referring to that 
day when all was declared to be good, when the morning stars sang 
together and all the Sons of God shouted for joy.</blockquote>
Other than that, he finds ridiculous Christian's interpretation of the 
card as "the Magus at the highest state of initiation" and Papus's that 
it is "the absolute." As for Levi, Waite says that Truth more properly 
applies to the 17th arcanum.<br>

For Oswald Wirth, the four creatures are the four elements, the four 
evangelists, and four bright stars, each in one of four cardinal points:
 the Bull's eye, the Lion's heart, the Eagle's light and the southern 
Fish which absorbs the watercarrier's water. From this astronomical 
perspective the Eagle corresponds to air, the man to water, the Bull to 
earth, and the Lion to fire. <br>
<br>
In Wirth's card, the two wands are both in one hand, the left. He 
explains that the red tip of one picks up fiery energy from the 
universe, which would go out but for the blue tip, which picks up air. 
It then goes through her body and is transmitted to the red sash by her 
left hand. For him her dancing represents the state of the universe, in 
constant change. Yet to the wise man the world is unitary, "the One 
Thing of the Hermetists." He adds,<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
By conceiving the radical Unity or oneness of what exists, we rise to 
Gnosis, the supreme reward for one who searches for the true.</blockquote>
Another reward is the "unlimited power" that comes with the "universal 
knowledge", "the realization of the ideal of skilled adept."<br>

Paul Foster Case identifies this card with "cosmic consciousness", 
defined as the knowledge that the Self of each of us is identical with 
the Self of the cosmos. To know oneself is to know oneself as identical 
with the highest Self of others and with the soul of the whole universe.
 In this unity the ox is earth and also that which gives form. The lion 
is fire, in other words energy, formless in itself and needing earth to 
give it form.<br>
<br>
A unique feature of Case's card is that the figure in the middle, whom 
he calls the World-Dancer and the Celestial Androgyne, holds spirals 
rather than wands. One turns to the right and the other to the left, so 
that they balance. They represent integration and disintegration, he 
says. The spiral, and in particular something called "the logarithmic 
spiral" is the basic form of the universe, Case says, "the form of all 
forms". He gives spiral nebulae as an example.&nbsp; What suggests the 
masculine in Case's dancer, he says, is the relatively stronger legs. 
The face to me looks rather feminine, as opposed to that of Paul 
Marteau's card and also of a version of Case's card done by someone 
else, which I put to the right of Case's. <br>
<br>
The result for Case a state of power as well as knowledge:<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The goal of the Great Work isto know the Self, but to know, as we mean 
it here, is not merely to witness, not merely t« be aware of something 
external, as when we say we "know” the various phenomena of our 
environment. The knowledge which completes the Great Work is 
identification with the Central Reality of the universe, and such 
knowledge is really the acme of practical power.</blockquote>
Thus the claims of the alchemists about the Philosopher's Stone are 
literally true for one who knows this "central reality", the means "for 
preserving their youth, expelling disease, preventing suffering, and 
providing themselves with all they require. Success in the Great Work so
 unites the personal self with the ONE IDENTITY that every detail of the
 personal existence is a conscious expression of the ALL POWER."<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Jungian Interpretations</b><br>
<br>
.Jung of course uses similar language as Case, to similar points. While 
having a feminine face, hair, and breasts her slender hips and sturdy 
legs suggest that her body combines masculine and feminine. In fact to 
me the Paul Marteau figure's face, unlike that of the standard Tarot of 
Marseille, has a masculine face (see the three TdM cards above). This of
 course goes back to the earliest version with a partially nude figure 
in the middle, as we have seen. For Nichols it is the unity and 
interplay of opposites. "The flowing scarf representThe two wands play a
 similar role, one negative and the other positive, in constant but also
 changing relationship to each other as she dances. She is not just 
running but dancing within the elliptical space.<br>
<br>
What the dance does is to unite the immediate feeling of being in the world with the universal and transcendent:<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Dance originated as a sacred act, a form of prayer, by which&nbsp; man put 
himself in tune with all nature and with the gods. Through rhythmic 
dance, man bridged the gap between between mortal time and 
transcendental time and experienced himself as part of an ever-changing 
process. Through ritual dance, the shaman put himself in tune with the 
universe to restore the equilibrium of nature so that he could call 
forth needed rain or effect healings. Through ecstatic dance, the 
dervish leaped outside mortal time, matching his rhythm to the whirling 
stars.</blockquote>
Other cards depict a kind of dance, especially the Hanged Man. But:<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Unlike the Hanged Man, who enacted the topsy-turvy jig of Fate's puppet,
 thedancer moves freely with one foot always touching the earth. 
Although she is in constant motion, she remains connected with the 
ground of her being.- golden and indestructible.</blockquote>
She quotes Maria von Franz:<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp;The experience of the Self brings a feeling of standing on solid ground
 inside oneself, on a patch of inner eternity which even physical death 
cannot touch.</blockquote>
Nichols emphasizes the connection to what both Jung and Case call the 
Self. Speaking of the dancer, she says, "In Jungian terms, she might 
symbolize the self, center of psychic wholeness." Not only that, but:<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The self is the center of our psychic equilibrium. When we lose touch 
with the dancer within, we lose our equilibrium.Whenever we lose touch 
with nature - our inner nature - we experience, deep down, a sense of 
inferiority. To be in contact with the natural self, deep down, is to 
feel neither inferior nor superior. </blockquote>
Jung points out that the level of the Self goes beyond the personal and into the collective;<br>
We can now see that the unconscious produces contents which are valid 
not only for the person concerned, but for others as well, in fact, for a
 great many people and possibly for all.<br>
Not only that, but:<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The deeper "layers" of the psyche lose their individual uniqueness as 
they retreat further and further into darkness. "Lower down" - that is 
to say, , as they approach the autonomous&nbsp; functional systems - they 
become increasingly collective&nbsp; until they are universalized and 
extinguished in the body's materiality, i.e. in the chemical bodies.&nbsp; 
The body's carbon is simply carbon. Hence at bottom the psyche is simply
 "world."</blockquote>
We may recall here the Neoplatonic concept of the <i>anima mundi</i>, 
the soul of the world. In alchemy it was seen as a force embedded in 
matter that animated all bodies from the stars to the animals, plants, 
and elements on earth."&nbsp; At the same time the Self expresses the 
collective in an individual way. Nichols quotes Jung: "The individual 
alone makes history." The individual is thus "that infinitesimal unit 
upon whom the world depends, and on whom, if we read the meaning of the 
Christian message right, even God seeks his goal."&nbsp; In that regard he 
says that Christ is a symbol of the Self, as the embodied divine..Thus 
the Celestial Jerusalem seen on one early card is replaced by the 
dancer, an individual in human form.<br>
<br>
This world, while consisting of the dance of particles and waves with 
only a tendency to exist, as studied by subatomic physics, is 
nonetheless for Jung more than the play of appearnces. What remains is 
the "psychoid layer of being" where two ways of being were reconciled.<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp;The common background of microphysics and depth psychology is as much 
physical as pysychic, and therefore neither, but rather a third thing, a
 neutral nature which can at most be grasped in hints since in essence 
it is transcendental.&nbsp;</blockquote>
It is the "unus mundus" of the mystics, of which he says "there is 
little or no hope that the unitary Being can ever be conceived, since 
our powers of thought and language permit only of antinomian statements.<br>
<br>
The dancer is enclosed in a wreath. This is the <i>temeno</i>s, the 
sacred enclosure in which along it is free to express itself, like the 
safe setting of the therapy room.&nbsp; In a similar way, she observes Christ
 and the Virgin Mary were traditionally put in such enclosures.She 
quotes Walt Whitman:<br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
I am an acme of things accomplished<br>
And I am an enclosure of things to be.</blockquote>
There is a nice interplay of opposites here: things accomplished are for
 the most part visible to all, things to be are not. We both are and are
 not, so an interplay of opposites.This is another feature of the Self, 
and of the divine; all opposites are of God, Jung says. By taking on 
this burden, God incarnates himself within one.<br>
<br>
We come to the four creatures, symbols of the four evangelists, 
witnesses to the incarnation of the divine and guides toward our own 
connection to the divine. On another level they are the building blocks 
of the cosmos, the four elements out of which all things were said to 
derive. They, too, contain opposites: hot vs. cold, dry vs. wet. The 
dancer is in this regard the quintessence, which is somehow beyond the 
opposites, yet connected with them. <br>
<br>
Exactly which&nbsp; creature stands for which element is a matter of dispute.
 Wirth identified the eagle with air and the man, as the water-carrier, 
with water. But the Anglo-American tradition has it the other way 
around, as Aquarius is an air sign and the eagle is somehow identified 
with Scorpio, which also corresponds to where the sign would have to be 
on the zodiacal circle, given the placement of the other three. It is 
clear that the animals originally had to do with Ezekiel, a product of 
Babylonian-influenced culture. Perhaps indeed the scorpion of later 
times substituted for the eagle of earlier times. In any case the four 
creatures play a dual role, as evangelists leading us outside the cosmos
 and as elements leading us into the cosmos. . <br>
<br>
An aspect of the four creatures that Nichols does not pursue is their 
relationship to the four suits and the four Jungian functions. Here 
again it does not matter how it is done. If so, the animals again form a
 pair of pairs, rational vs. irrational, which again divide into 
opposites, thinking vs. feeling and sensation vs. intuition. Their unity
 is in one way the card itself, whose meaning can be thought about, 
felt, observed, and intuited: the four functions in the corners suggest 
the fifth in the center, who 
in shifting from side to side and up and down holds all four in her 
movement. In another respect the dancer might represent a fifth function
 that Jung called the transcendent function, that which unites the 
conscious with the unconscious. It is a dialogue in which opposing 
viewpoints are juxtaposed, interact in "active imagination", until 
finally an equilibrium is reached.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Here I am reminded of a text, surely corresponding to a tradition, in 
which on the Mount of Olives before Jesus is arrested, he sings a hymn 
to prepare the disciples for what is to come, to which the disciples 
dance in a circle.. The hymn proclaims that "To each and all it is given
 to dance" (also translated as "the whole on high is a dance", where the
 heavenly beings dance in time with the disciples). Through the dance 
one may both embrace suffering and transcend it: "If thou understoodest 
suffering, thou wouldst have nonsuffering."(or, "know how to suffer and 
thou wilt have nonsuffering"). It is translated in various places, one 
of which is by Max Pulver, in <i>The Mysteries: Papers from the Eranos Yearbooks</i>,
 edited by Joseph Campbel and translated by Ralph Mannheim. It reminds 
Pulver of another song, or poem, by the German mystic Mechthild of 
Magdeburg (c.1207-c.1282), an unusual account of the Virgin.&nbsp; Between 
the 15th and late 19th 
century this text was relatively unknown; but it fits. Mechthield 
imagines the Lord saying to 
her (pp. 175-176):
<br>
<blockquote>
Maiden, dance as deftly before me as my elect has danced before thee.</blockquote>
And the Virgin replies: <br>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
I would not dance, Lord, unless thou leadest me.<br>
Wouldst thou that I spring mightily,<br>
Then must thou sing for me.<br>
Thus will I leap into love,<br>
From love into knowledge,<br>
From knowledge into joy,<br>
From joy beyond all human senses.</blockquote>
Then we are in the realm of the divine Fool, as the God beyond 
number and concepts, a return to the divine source. <BR><BR><BR>
