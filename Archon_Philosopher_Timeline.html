<td>The Demiurge - Persian: <span class="name">Zurvan</span>; Mesopotamian: <span class="name">Nammu</span>; Egyptian: <span class="name">Ptah</span> and the allies were all predisposed to move the agenda along by assisting humans in quickly getting control over their newly placed terrain. Math, language, science, law, agriculture were all quickly established at a high level. The names accorded to the Demiurgic species were different in different places but they also changed over the centuries in one location, for example from earliest <span class="name">Ptah</span> (in Memphis), to <span class="name">Atum</span> (in Heliopolis) to later on <span class="name">Amun</span> and then <span class="name">Amun-Ra</span>. </td>

<td class="date"><span class="small">circa</span> 2000 <span class="small">BCE</span></td>
<td>The mentoring went too far and inter/hybrid breeding took place, likely violating established "husbandry" practice for the Archons. In this confusion of the <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/firstnexus.png">First Nexus</a>, human attention towards the complex metaphysics and interrelations of the Archons distracted from the agenda, whatever it was. So a cleansing took place with most 
Archons returning to their own nodes, with some escaping; perhaps <span class="name">Nimrod</span>, <span class="name">Mithra</span>, <span class="name">Thoth/Orpheus/Hermes Trismigestus/Cadmus</span>, <span class="name">Mede</span>, <span class="name">Og</span>, and likely also the founding Tage of the Etruscan civilization. <BR><BR><small>Note: the deluge was not necessarily one of water.</small></td>

<td class="date">2000 <span class="small">BCE - </span>800 <span class="small">BCE</span></td>
<td><span class="name">Abraham</span>, <span class="name">Zoroaster</span> and <span class="name">Akhenaten</span> were all given an opportunity to solve the metaphysical disarray. <span class="name">Akhenaten</span> failed almost immediately; <span class="name">Zoroaster</span> succeeded well, but the Abrahamic Revealation lasted longest and is today the dominant metaphysics in the Wider Western Civilization.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Antedeluvian Memories Arise</td>
<td class="date">800 <span class="small">BCE -</span> 100 <span class="small">BCE</span></td>
<td>Documents from pre-deluge were included into Abrahamic compliations and the existence of clay tablets, rock carvings and oral tradition kept alive
the old knowledge: angel worship thrived while interactions between humans and Archons continued at a sporadic rate. Some portion of the <i>Sybilline Books</i> 
was likely purchased by <span class="name">Plato</span> and some ideas were likely included in his final work: <i>Timaeus</i>. In this book, the Abrahamic God and pantheon of Greek Gods was replaced by mention of the Demiurge as creator of the physical world. <BR><BR> Simultaneous with the rise of Angel Worship in Mesopotamia, the Hermetic Tradition began to expand with <span class="name">Thoth</span>'s outlook in Egypt, and Greece attempted to make sense of the Archonic experience of others as passed down. Frustration by the Archons grew as human focus was again drawn towards making sense of the metaphysical disarray.</td>

<tr>
<td>Syncretism  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>The Second Nexus</small></td>
<td class="date">100 <span class="small">BCE - </span>100 <span class="small">CE</span></td>
<td>The arrival of <span class="name">Jesus</span> amidst the Gnostic, Neoplatonic, Hermetic, and Greek philosophic ideas likely resulted in the Demiurgic/Archonic agenda going off course, signaling that a re-direction toward the agenda needed to be asserted. This intellectual confusion can be thought of as a metaphysical event known as <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/secondnexus.png">The Second Nexus</a>. Those seeking practical military/economic/worldly advantages and those seeking understanding of the field of experience were clearly at odds and the human quest for universal knowledge was quieted with hedonism (bread and circus) and with destruction of respect for men (constant war||gynocentrism), leading to first the rise and then the fall of the Western Roman Empire. </td>

<tr>
<td>Roman Centralization (Corporatist Control) over Humans Begin As Gnostic Thought First Rises and Then Is Suppressed</td>
<td class="date">100 <span class="small">CE - </span>600 <span class="small">CE</span></td>
<td>Rome's corporate structure assisted the corporatization of religion which then went into service for the state, with Constantite institutionalizing Christianity in 343 and the Council of Rome creating internal enemies to distract from the content of the message. Later, external enemies (Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism) cemented the worldly and materialistic as having priority over the spiritual and metaphysical.  </td>
</tr>



<tr>
<td>Islamic Golden Age</td>
<td class="date">650 - 1250 </td>
<td>The flowering of science that occurred immediately after Islamic rule took hold was corraling humans back onto the Archonic agenda. Sufi mysticism was securely monotheistic and any pantheistic or panentheistic thought was shunned. Stagnation in Baghdad moved the dynamic center of the Wider Western Civilization to Samarkand, just before a force pushed these newly fossilizing ideas westward: that force was the Mongol Invasion. </td>
</tr>



<tr>
<td>Science Re-invigorated</td>
<td class="date">1250 - <span class="name">Copernicus</span></td>
<td>Alchemaic ideas and the rationalistic empiricsm of Platonic/Aristotilean thought began to percolate in those areas of Europe un-molested
by the Mongols. Scholaticism allowed a monothesistic God to reign supreme while securely promising a rational interpretation of the world, which
meant explaining the lights in the sky. The culmination of this was two-fold: the Scientific Method of <span class="name">Francis Bacon</span>, and the Heliocentric Model by <span class="name">Nicolus Copernicus</span>.
Simultaneous with this was the infusion of speculative thought into the Kabbala by the book Zohar and its interpretation by <span class="name">Isaac Luria</span>.<BR><BR> It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that the intellectual breakthrough of <span class="name">Copernicus</span> fulfilled the agenda given to <span class="name">Abraham</span> in the apocraphal text <i>Testament of Abraham</i> to "number the stars". The immediately following Nuremberg Event of 1561 began a new phase of Archonic interference, of excitement and concern over human technological advances, including a population growth that denies Archons the ability for sufficient control.</td>
</tr>



<tr>
<td>Theosophy and Modern Science</td>
<td class="date">1600 - 1914 </td>
<td>While the Scientific Method, <B>modern science</b>, allowed Europe to gain technological advantage and to uncover mysteries within and outside the Wider Western Civilization, 
the new power of epistemological philosophy coupled with <b>modern science</b>, coupled with the unearthing of non-monthesistic texts and artefacts, reinfused humans with a metaphysical thirst to 
understand the recently reemerged metaphysical uncertainty. Through a variety of hermetic, magical, spiritual and syncretic approaches, humans developed both speculative systems, such as the Lurian Kabbala, 
and this combined with rigorous mathematical and philosophic ideas and modern science to allow humans powerful intellectual tools to accurately assess the full topological field of experience. <BR><BR>
However, modern Science, notably the experiments of <span class="name">Albert Michelson</span> and <span class="name">Edward Morley</span> and <span class="name">George Airy</span>, were overturning the Copernican Hypothesis and placing the Archonic agenda in turmoil. Likely from the position of the Archons, this situation had to be stopped, and the 20<sup>th</sup> century history of wars and narrative control were effective in quelling nosy minds.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>Corporatized Science, Fear, and Censorship</td>
<td class="date">1914 - 2001</td>
<td>In order to save the Copernican Model, a rapid and near total capture of <B>modern science</b> by government and private esoteric vested interests was managed via the university structure, grant giving, media manipulation, and intelligence agency interference. Total war and/or fear of total war was an instrument of control and advent of "non-disclosure agreement" and threat of removal of pensions were a potent institutional force to cower men and control narrative. Thus the standard model of astronomy (Copernican System) was promoted to the exclusion of other ideas. <BR><BR>Fantasy ideas such as the quasi-magical dark-energy/dark-matter and associated idea of an uncaused-big bang were introduced to keep the dominant narrative alive, while by the turn of the second millenium, now with widely available recording devices, undeniable-to-those-witnessing, large numbers of unknown ultra-high technology craft were routinely recorded flying though earth's skies, throwing the dominant narrative into doubt.</td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td>The Awakening & Archon Philosopher's Metaphysical Perspective &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Third Nexus</small></td>
<td class="date">2001 - Current</td>
<td><i>The Awakening</i>, a term of knowledge awareness admist the <a href="archonphilosopherdictionaryfiles/thirdnexus.png"> The Third Nexus</a>, is a result of the internet and other technologies allowing humans to "compare notes". Given the admissions by the American military, on the back of similar admissions by the Peruvian, Mexican and Russian militaries of Unidentified Aerial Phenonon, the interest in uncovering hidden knowledge has grown exponentially. Occulted knowledge, such as that of the Double Slit Experiment and Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser Experiment, have allowed widespread questioning of the nature of existence. <BR><BR>
Fighting this Awakening, the dehumanization of populations via social credit punishment and censorship by both human and algorithmic AI is coupled with a desantification of life and bald attempts at bringing in a Transhumanist agenda. 

<BR><BR>It is unclear as to the overall purpose of Archonic intervention in the early 21<sup>st</sup> century, other than if we think of the Demiurge and Archons as leaders of a Type III Civilization but moreso as farmers, perhaps more akin to beekeepers as they do not really need to kill us to gain the resources humans provide. It is likely, however, that they seek to maintain a status quo for achieving the Copernican Revolution, with all future technological developments not as particularly useful but as very likely a common result seen many times before. It should be finally noted that Archons were likely once as primitive as humans, but graduated into their own powers with leave of the Demiurge to do so. Thus, it remains contingent on human actions to earn the right to arrive at the next level: to be aware of humans as angels, as Archons, as an incredibly important and valuable part of this universe.  <BR><BR>In the position of the Archon Philosopher, the central power of humans was to collapse the wave-function of those lights once described in the Copernican Hypothesis in the sky as real physical bodies, allowing the Demiurge and Archons to harvest these massive amounts of resources, this tremendous quantity of electrons. It should be remembered:<BR>  <span class="center">All life requires resources.</span></td>
