<p>Background:
<p>The word <i>Egregore</i> derives from the Greek word egrégoroi, meaning <i>Watchers</i>, which also transliterates as <i>grigori</i>. The word appears in the Septuagint translation of the Book of Lamentations, as well as the Book of Jubilees and the Book of Enoch.

<p>An egregore, or egregor, is a metaphysical term for a sort of group consciousness, like a Zeitgeist, or an archetype, or a meme, as per Dawkins. It derives from the Hebrew word for "angel" and also for "city", and it has enjoyed many misadventures on its way to English. Like a servitor entity, an egregore is created - whether intentionally or otherwise - by people. But unlike a servitor, an egregore is shared by more than one person, and its power increases as it is invoked.</p></div>

<h2>How to Define Egregore</h2>


<p>An egregore, or egregor, is a metaphysical term for a sort of group consciousness, like a zeitgeist or an archetype. It derives from the Hebrew word for "angel" and also for "city", and it has enjoyed many misadventures on its way to English. Like a servitor entity, an egregore is created—whether intentionally or otherwise—by people. But unlike a servitor, an egregore is shared by more than one person, and its power increases as it is invoked.</p>

<p>Nations have flags, songs and customs, social scenes have their own music, clothing style, "look" and trends, and even churches have their own ritualism. All of these feed into an egregore, like a magickal group ritual repeated many times.</p>

<h2>How Are Egregores Formed?</h2>

<p>Egregores often start as an intentional act of creating a servitor entity for someone's personal use. If others begin to work with the servitor, it can gather momentum— much like a kind of intelligent morphic field—and sentience, and start to act upon its own. As a sentient being sustained by the choices of others, it can find better ways to accomplish the agenda for which it was created. As its influence expands, it can take on bigger goals to accomplish its agenda in more powerful ways. Fotamecus, for example, was initially created to compress and expand time, but once his sigil was posted on the internet and more people began to work with him, he became much more powerful and began to take on Time itself.</p>


<p>Occasionally, egregores can be created unintentionally, by a strong desire or strong unformed tide of emotion, or even by a corporate marketing campaign. A lot of people working to accomplish a goal, or even a societal desire or need that isn't often expressed but resides just beneath the surface, will form egregores as well. If enough people want something enough, it will take on a life all its own, as they say. They're like a kind of Greco-Roman deity, a metaphysical entity created with a particular theme or purpose, whether this creation is focussed and intentionally established or not. When a website, for example, soars in popularity and renown, its egregore has gotten quite powerful. As sentient beings created by a collaborative choice, egregores can be considered "team spirit", in a very literal sense.</p>

<figcaption><p class="tml-image--caption" itemprop="caption">The sigil for Fotamecus, a servitor entity who has since grown into an egregore.</p></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Egregores can often tie into and interact with each other. For example, a website's egregore would be under the dominion of the internet's own egregore, which demonstrated its significant power as far back as 1999.</p>

<p>Sometimes, servitors can become egregores if they're worked with enough, by enough people. As they grow, their power and their agendas expand, particularly as they get more input from those who work with them. Egregores get a certain sense of what's desired by those who work with them, and increasingly act upon more fundamental motivations than they may have been designed with.</p>

<p>It's wonderful to think that as many people encounter an egregore, it gets an increased sense of where it should be in the grand scheme of things. For example, my experience leads me to think that what the egregore Fotamecus is actually after isn't so much to dissolve the confines of Time, but rather to loosen the binding chains of Causality itself—that "law" or perception that Event A causes Event B, which in turn causes Event C. Looking at Creation from a spiritual perspective, Love causes all things... and what wasn't caused by Love was never truly created in the first place, but rather just a joyless illusion. This is the only way to reconcile belief in an omnipotent, Loving, Perfect Creator with the world we see around us.</p>

<h2>Ghouls Gone Wild</h2><p>When an egregore gets powerful enough, it often becomes difficult for its creator to control it anymore. Like any teenager, it's now old enough to accomplish its agenda as and how it sees fit. If the goals of an egregore were initially less than benevolent, it can easily go off the rails and become a very powerful force for a negative or selfish agenda in the world. The timeline is rife with this sort of thing happening, all over the world. From the cliched villains on Saturday morning cartoons making Faustian pacts with stronger, malign entities who eventually snack upon them, to Tibettan folklore of tulpas (living thoughtforms made real) going sinister and out of control, to Japanese mythology about kami (sentient nature spirits), when worshipped inadequately or not at all, cursing people and going violent and destructive, to Hebrew folklore about priests making golems who later went berserk.</p>

<p>Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein, the first science-fiction novel ever, and in the 1960s and 70s when computers were just emerging we had all sorts of computers and robots getting out of hand. Even <em>The Simpsons</em> had giant corporate mascots becoming animate, sentient and destructive in "Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores". With computers becoming so commonplace and accepted, we seldom have stories like this today. Instead, we just live out that kind of science fiction on a daily basis with oppressive corporate and nationalistic agendas that nobody can seem to put a stop to.</p>

<p>Egregores like notoriety. Of course they do. They enjoy it for the same reason that celebrities enjoy publicity—if they don't stay in the public eye, they fade away. They're fueled by our dreams, our hopes, our wishes and our desires. But in order to remain worthwhile and relevant, in order to gain positive notoriety and not behave destructively, they must pursue a benevolent agenda and they must do it benevolently. Because their agenda is created by someone who may not have thought it through all the way, the agenda that it pursues may be very goal-oriented and short-sighted. It may need some fine-tuning, to redefine its agenda in a way that is more in harmony with greater overall agendas.</p>

<p>In another article, I outlined a map of superior states of Creation and of consciousness. The closer one is to a True State of Creation, the more leverage one has against lesser positionalities, because those lesser positionalities have less Creative force behind them—they're less real. This kind of High Magick seems to be the only effective approach to a situation like this, because the kind of leverage that kind of position affords can provide enough clout to overhaul the agendas of powerful but potentially miscast entities like destructive egregores. By reassessing the basic agenda and motives of an egregore from a superior state of consciousness, one can redefine it in a healthier, more positive way. This basic Light-dispelling-Darkness motif is prevalent throughout the cultural mythology of the world, and this kind of "egregore career counseling" is a peaceful approach that does not create friction because it is nonaggressive. And if for some reason the egregore should decide to resist or reject this "tuning up", one can take solace in the fact that a lower positionality necessarily results in a greater authority to leash the egregore once more, bringing it under more constructive control.</p>

<p>The implications of this are absolutely staggering. We know that egregores are not just created intentionally by occult practitioners, but that they also exist in large corporate and political agendas; indeed, nationalism itself has all the hallmarks of egregorehood. From a superior state of consciousness founded in Love, one can address, interact with, counsel, and if necessary bind entire corporations and nations as spirit-based entities. </p>

<p><strong>"...[b]oth the ancient Romans, and quite recently the Chinese, have recognized the existence of guardian spirits set over cities. Indeed, one author reports as follows on the occult war waged on enemy cities by ancient Rome: `The Romans, when besieging a city, made a habit of carefully enquiring the name of the city and of its guardian spirit. When they knew these, they would summon the guardian spirit of the city and its inhabitants, and conquer it.'" </strong></p><p>- Willy Schrodter, from: <em>Commentaries on The Occult Philosophy of Agrippa</em><strong></strong></p>

<p>A mage attempting to realign an egregore with more fundamental values will have a much easier time of it than the Romans did. After all, the mage isn't attempting to "take over" or bind the egregore—it isn't a battle of Wills, and presumably the mage doesn't truly want control over the egregore. Rather, what the mage wants is to correct the aberrant approach of the egregore, getting down to the basics of what the egregore's purpose and nature is to a more refined degree. It's somewhat like a software patch, a purification, or assistance with self-actualization. Like an exorcism, the power of the mage to do this doesn't come from the mage alone, but from what the law refers to as "derivation of authority".</p>


<p>In attempting to harmonize the egregore with more powerful Divine laws of Creation, one is working from a derivation of authority of Divine Love, like a priest exorcising in the name of a higher power. But unlike an exorcism, the mage is working in the interests of the egregore itself, to allow it to fulfil its potential in a more efficient and effective way. This means that there is no inherent conflict of interest between the mage and the egregore, although the egregore is of course free to disagree. Disagreement, however does not change the fact that the mage's motivation gives them a superior derivation of authority over the egregore, no matter how powerful that egregore otherwise is. This is simply due to the nature of Creation.</p>


<p>In its True State, everything is Perfect. It is only when something rejects an alignment with Love that it appears to mutate into something repulsive and warped. What the mage is seeking to do in realigning an egregore is merely to dispel this warped illusion through an agenda of Love, supplying the Love that was missing in the egregore's agenda, and applying a little spiritual insight and creativity to redefine the egregore's nature and agenda as something that is more in accordance with Divine Will, and its own True Nature.</p>


<p>This apparent "change" is only a "change" on a manifest level. What the mage is seeking is to self-actualize the egregore, unlocking what the egregore's True Nature—or something much closer to it—is and always was. The mage is striving to better align the egregore more fully with its own inherent benevolent Purpose, whatever the mage who initially created it envisioned its Purpose to be. The Purpose should ideally be as close as possible to the egregore's predefined Purpose, and altered only inasmuch as its new Purpose is better aligned with Love. After all, just like a good parent the mage's goal isn't to tell the egregore what to be, but rather to enable it to live a healthy, functional, satisfying existence.</p>

<h2>Propagating Egregores</h2>
<p>Propagating egregores typically involves spreading its sigil publicly, to increase its power. Some occult practitioners have found that spreading awareness and recognition of an egregore or servitor entity by spreading its sigil and description through the internet, or simply advertising its sigil offline, to be enormously powerful, but I'd like to propose a slightly more novel approach.</p>

<p>Basically, what's in a name? A rose is a rose, after all. If an egregore is to embody a certain approach, objective, purpose or agenda, surely it can be referenced by that agenda, rather than by its' name or sigil. Suppose, for example, you wanted to create an egregore whose purpose was to embody and enhance manifestations of benevolence in the world, and in people's lives. (This is admittedly high, spiritually-based magick, rather than low magick, but it's what I generally practice anyway.) So rather than promote your egregore by placing sigils around your neighborhood and the internet, you would promote it by making choices that were in accordance with benevolence. Egregores are collective choice, after all. How better to contribute to it?</p>

<p>By making spiritually powerful choices, one can invest in great amounts of metaphysical strength, and use that potency to strengthen an egregore. Writing internet articles is a great way to propagate anything truly worthwhile, and combining it with an agenda of benevolence is very easy to do. In fact, it's what I've been doing. Every act of Love or benevolence strengthens every other act of it, and it is my hope that the "spirit" of benevolence and Love will grow more powerful in its effects upon us all.</p>

<h3>How do we work with spiritual concepts while maintaining contemporary and secular sensibilities?</h3>

<div style="height: 22px;"></div>

<p>One of the questions I receive most frequently around my synesthesia-based sociocultural framework is “What even is an egregore, anyway?” There are several definitions floating around out there which don’t seem to provide much clarity. Some people use it as an updated synonym for what our ancestors might have called “spirits” or “demigods.” Others use it as an abstraction for the workings of a human collective, the way an individual can have an experience of the individual will becoming subsumed by something greater, like a crowd or a religion.

<p>I’ve also seen it used to refer specifically to the concept of an idea itself taking on a life of its own, even given a personality and will by those who “summon” it, as in the mystical concept of a tulpa. A more technology-based concept might be to compare it to the idea of a monad, as used in functional programming, within a computational universe.

<p>For me, it’s a way of invoking any or all of these things at once. But in order to understand the way I use the concept, you don’t need to have a full understanding of every aspect of what an egregore can be. I mostly use it as an abstraction for understanding the complexity of entities which have both volition and relationships to other entities.


<p>My synesthesia also applies it to things that we typically think of as lifeless and inert, but the experience I have of a strange form of “empathy” for such things is far outside the scope of the current article.

<p>What matters most here is how an input structure and an output structure—the sensory perception and the capability for action, made up of of any combination of subsystems—are able to combine to create a structure of values that affect the behavior of an abstract entity.

<p>At heart, my concept of an egregore is any entity that is a component of greater abstractive systems, has its own system of functioning, and is composed of lesser abstractive systems.

<h2>The Mathematical Foundations of Complexity</h2>
<p>It’s not a coincidence that the term “complex numbers” is used when i, the square root of -1, comes into play in mathematics.


<p>I still remember the way my father explained complex numbers to me, shortly after I dropped out of middle school: “There’s positive and negative, and then there’s weird positive and weird negative,” he told me. It kind of felt like a fractal made out of the very concepts of positive and negative.

<p>There were real numbers, which were based on the idea of material quantities. Then there were imaginary numbers, which were based on the root of -1 and felt kind of like getting a glimpse into another plane of existence. When real numbers and imaginary numbers combined, they made complex numbers, which secretly described every number imaginable, because either side of the combination could potentially be 0.

<p>Complexity means something distinct from how complicated a structure is. Looking at complex numbers as a conceptual model suggests that an abstract entity can be made up of different parts that don’t necessarily correspond to each other directly or add together cleanly. Parts which appear to add to the structure might take away from it instead, depending on what operations are performed.

<p>This introduces chaos, or the inability to directly predict output just by looking at input. Context and relationships between the parts of a system also matter.

<p>It can be similar to our sense of smell and taste. The sour flavors of citrus fruit can be used to make something seem more salty than it actually is for the sake of a low-sodium diet, but they can also be used to make alcoholic drinks taste less of the bitterness of alcohol.

<p>So how do these concepts end up applying to things which have behavior, like people?

<h2>Synergy, Sabotage, and Co-Evolution</h2>
<p>We humans are obligate social creatures—we can even die if we don’t get enough contact with others at an early enough age. Like many creatures, we participate in an ecosystem made up of all kinds of different relationships, both symbiotic and adversarial. Let’s look at our relationships with a few different creatures as a way of illustrating the main components of an egregore: the one, the many, and one of three relational structures within the system. These relational structures can work in combination, but for now, we’ll just look at their simplest forms.

<p>We’ve co-evolved for a very direct collaboration with dogs. These days, we’ll even romanticize the relationship between a child and a dog as one of the most pure and loving connections a person can experience—right up there with having a loving mother in infancy or building a lifelong romantic connection. I certainly remember some of my lonelier days as a kid, when I lamented that nobody but my dogs seemed to understand me.

<p>In the relationship between a human and a dog, we tend to serve as the head of the egregore while our dog serves as the heart of the egregore. We tend to be in charge of the actions of the group, and we provide a structure and a purpose for our dog to work under, even if these days that’s as likely to be something as simple as keeping us company as it is to require the use of the hunting, herding, and guarding instincts that still live on in various breeds. Humans who develop a strong enough bond with a dog will often prioritize their canine companion over just about anything else. The depth of that bond pushes the instinctive buttons we have inside us related to the idea of “being part of something bigger than ourselves.”

<p>Meanwhile, some of our historically greatest enemies in co-evolution have been the mouse and the rat. I’m personally among those who has enjoyed a beautiful relationship with a fairly large number of pet rats, and I’ve been astonished at the way one of my friends has even made a hobby of taming wild ones! But most times and places, this relationship has been especially adversarial. They steal our food, they compromise our buildings, they spread disease, and we try to prevent them from doing any of these things. Fortunes have been made and broken via attempts to build a better mousetrap, and it’s hard to deny that both we and the rodents have grown more clever from our mutual arms race. To be part of an adversarial egregore keeps its constituent parts sharp—this is part of the reason so many humans enjoy taking part in competitive games: as a motivator towards continuous self-improvement.

<p>Of course, we also have to consider the cat, a creature that possesses a deep specialization for hunting the rodents with whom we have such an adversarial relationship. They’re smaller than us, and can get a tasty and filling meal rather than just avoiding harm the way we do by catching rodents. Our collaboration with them has never been quite as direct or as hierarchical as with dogs, regardless of cat people’s jokes about serving their cats. Though they tend to be in a more companionate role now, it used to be a practical necessity to keep cats in order to keep rodents and snakes away from livestock and food. We’d offer them food and shelter from the elements in exchange for their hunting skills, and might even develop a friendlier relationship with them in the process.

<p>Any of these relational styles can apply to the relationship between humans and other humans, other creatures, or even technological entities. Some of the most powerful and pernicious egregores that we tend to encounter on a daily basis are the ones I typically name Number-Go-Up and Divide-And-Conquer, which are in a collaborative relationship with each other, but are collectively in something closer to a combination of an adversarial and convenient relationship with their own constituent parts.

<h4>So how do these entities override our individual agency?</h4>

<h2>The Madness of the Outgroup</h2>
<p>Have you ever had the experience of getting swept up in the crowd? Even if you haven’t, I would venture that you’re at least familiar with the concept. This doesn’t only happen in crowds, of course. Sometimes it seems like humans have two primary modes of operation: that of being an individual agent and that of being an agent of…something else. Something bigger than the individual, with its own interests and motivations. It might be a religion, a shared personal identity, or even just a group of kids who have decided that one of their peers is “uncool.”

<p>Much like us as individuals, the groups that we participate in have their own motivations, their own behaviors, and their own defense mechanisms. And the meeting of two egregores, like the meeting of two minds, creates a third, distinct entity, one which might be collaborative, adversarial, or convenient. One of the common experiences of contemporary public discourse is that of people seeing each other as generic agents of the Dreaded Outgroup rather than as an individual. It can manifest in a few predictable ways, which tend to have roughly the following shape:

<p>Person A, who is part of Group A, posts or comments something online.

<p>Person B, who is part of Group B—which on the whole is not very friendly with Group A—responds to Person A.

<p>Each person is using language that, within their own ingroup, signals that they are interacting with each other as sovereign individuals. However, one or both of them have used a signal that tells the other person that they are outgroup to each other.

<p>One or both people may or may not make earnest attempts to use their own ingroup’s call-and-response to enter “individual mode” rather than “egregore mode.” However, when these scripts are invoked with the adversarial outgroup, they often serve the exact opposite function! Each person who does this tends to have the experience of attempting to treat the other person with respect, yet being met with adversarial or bad-faith conduct.

<p>One or both people labels the other as outgroup, often invoking a stereotype about how members of that group are somehow inferior in their logic, despite the real problem being that they are talking past each other.

<p>The interaction reinforces both the group affiliation of the individuals and the boundaries between the two groups.

<p>This dynamic can be mitigated by in-person interaction, though other forms of prejudice apply in that context. As I mentioned above, the structure we use to relate is itself part of the relevant egregores, which manifest differently via different means of communication.

<h2>The Meta-Perspective as the Universal Outgroup</h2>
<p>I’ve had many conversations with people in my closest circles lamenting the way that our interest in nuance gets us labeled as the Dreaded Outgroup by both sides of a given conflict. In fact, to tie this back in with The Political Mythology of Women’s Rights, I recently invoked the idea of the pro-abortion faction building direct support structures for women seeking abortions in the exact way many of my San Francisco circles claimed they were going to do around various causes if Trump were elected.

<p>I suggested that it would be more productive towards that faction’s ends to build systems of support going beyond “I’ll host you and pay for your travel/abortion” than to see things as an all-or-nothing, federal-level struggle—for example, providing support in permanently relocating politically aligned women, hosting them while they established new residency, and offering various kinds of financial support and employment assistance. It seemed directly in line with what I’d seen suggested time and time again around when the 2016 election was going on.

<p>One fellow completely ignored any of the words I was saying or the kinds of support systems that I was suggesting, declaring that because this suggestion had included the notion of supporting pregnant women, that I was “transparently” suggesting that they “[bring] it to full term in most circumstances”… I still don’t quite understand how he got from “relocate women who want abortions to your pro-abortion jurisdiction and help them become productive residents of that area” to accusing me of insisting that they bring their pregnancies to term.

<p>But that’s the power of the ingroup-outgroup divide, I suppose. Divide-And-Conquer, as a distinct entity from its constituents, has its own motivations and its own defense mechanisms, foremost among them the notion of “if you’re not with us, you’re against us.” It experiences the most vague potential for an individual to separate from its motivational and behavioral structure as painfully unacceptable, and so in such a contentious environment, even a single word can invoke deeply emotionally evocative purity-testing mechanisms.

<p>Few individuals have the patience to figure out how to overcome these defenses—but the good news is that the problem has already been solved, and all we have to do is adapt the principles involved to contemporary discourse.

<p>In the next article, we’ll explore the Divide-And-Conquer and Number-Go-Up egregores, their origins, and the social structures that have always been and will continue to be their Kryptonite.

Everything that feeds on negative feelings, on anxiety, fear and
superstition, despair or doubt, are in reality hostile forces in supersensible
worlds, launching cruel attacks on human beings, while they are being fed.<BR><BR>

Therefore, it is above all necessary to begin with that the person who enters
the spiritual world overcomes fear, feelings of helplessness, despair and anxiety.<BR><BR>


But these are exactly the feelings that belong to contemporary culture and
materialism; because it estranges people from the spiritual world, it is
especially suited to evoke hopelessness and fear of the unknown in
people, thereby calling up the above mentioned hostile forces against them.<span style="font-size: 3em; line-height: 0.05em; vertical-align: sub;">»</span><BR><BR>

<div class="narrow"><p class="figurer2"><span style="font-size: 3em; vertical-align: sub;">←</span>&nbsp; It is the position of the Archon Philosopher that egregors - either invisible metaphysical entities or visible Archons - are not essentially negatively predisposed towards humans: that is, they are not primarily moral entities; but do have agendas in the case of Archons.<BR><BR>

Thus, while the metaphysical entities may seem to coordinate and structure reality to the detriment of human endeavors, this is merely a confluence and not malicious. For Archons who seek to harness resources from humans, these Archons will be interacting according to their natures, while ultimately, given both their great technological advantage and the more than 6,000 years that they have had near absolute power over humans, these Archons tend not towards creating a negative experience for humans.

<p class="figurer2">According to The Book of Jubilees, the Watchers are the sons of God (Genesis 6) sent from heaven
to instruct the children of men; they fell after they descended to earth and cohabited with the
daughters of men, for which act they were condemned and became fallen angels. <br>
But not all Watchers descended: those that remained are the holy Watchers, and they reside
in the 5th Heaven. The evil Watchers dwell either in the 3rd Heaven or in Hell.</p>
